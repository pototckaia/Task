Chapter One
Amma
1
Amma
is walking along the promenade of the waterway that bisects her city, a few early morning barges cruise slowly by
to her left is the nautical-themed footbridge with its deck-like walkway and sailing mast pylons
to her right is the bend in the river as it heads east past Waterloo Bridge towards the dome of St Paul’s
she feels the sun begin to rise, the air still breezy before the city clogs up with heat and fumes
a violinist plays something suitably uplifting further along the promenade
Amma’s play,The Last Amazon of Dahomey, opens at the National tonight
she thinks back to when she started out in theatre
when she and her running mate, Dominique, developed a reputation for heckling shows that offended their political sensibilities
their powerfully trained actors’ voices projected from the back of the stalls before they made a quick getaway
they believed in protest that was public, disruptive and downright annoying to those at the other end of it
she remembers pouring a pint of beer over the head of a director whose play featured semi-naked black women running around on stage behaving like idiots
before doing a runner into the backstreets of Hammersmith
howling
Amma then spent decades on the fringe, a renegade lobbing hand grenades at the establishment that excluded her
until the mainstream began to absorb what was once radical and she found herself hopeful of joining it
which only happened when the first female artistic director assumed the helm of the National three years ago
after so long hearing a polite no from her predecessors, she received a phone call just after breakfast one Monday morning when her life stretched emptily ahead with only online television dramas to look forward to
love the script, must do it, will you also direct it for us? I know it’s short notice, but are you free for coffee this week at all?
Amma takes a sip of her Americano with its customary kick-starter extra shot in it as she approaches the Brutalist grey arts complex ahead
at least they try to enliven the bunker-like concrete with neon light displays these days and the venue has a reputation for being progressive rather than traditionalist
years ago she expected to be evicted as soon as she dared walk through its doors, a time when people really did wear their smartest clothes to go to the theatre
and looked down their noses at those not in the proper attire
she wants people to bring their curiosity to her plays, doesn’t give a damn what they wear, has her ownsod-you style, anyway, which has evolved, it’s true, away from the clichéd denim dungarees, Che Guevara beret, PLO scarf and ever-present badge of two interlocked female symbols (talk about wearing your heart on your sleeve, girl)
these days she wears silver or gold trainers in winter, failsafe Birkies in summer
winter, it’s black slacks, either baggy or tight depending on whether she’s a size 12 or 14 that week (a size smaller on top)
summer, it’s patterned harem pants that end just below the knee
winter, it’s bright asymmetric shirts, jumpers, jackets, coats
year-round her peroxide dreadlocks are trained to stick up like candles on a birthday cake
silver hoop earrings, chunky African bangles and pink lipstick
are her perennial signature style statement
Yazz
recently described her style as‘a mad old woman look, Mum’, pleads with her to shop in Marks& Spencer like normal mothers, refuses to be spotted alongside her when they’re supposed to be walking down the street together
Yazz knows full well that Amma will always be anything but normal, and as she’s in her fifties, she’s not old yet, although try tellingthat to a nineteen-year-old; in any case, ageing is nothing to be ashamed of
especially when the entire human race is in it together
although sometimes it seems that she alone among her friends wants to celebrate getting older
because it’s such a privilege to not die prematurely, she tells them as the night draws in around her kitchen table in her cosy terraced house in Brixton
as they get stuck into the dishes each one has brought: chickpea stew, jerk chicken, Greek salad, lentil curry, roasted vegetables, Moroccan lamb, saffron rice, beetroot and kale salad, jollof quinoa and gluten-free pasta for the really irritating fusspots
as they pour themselves glasses of wine, vodka (fewer calories), or something more liver-friendly if under doctor’s orders
she expects them to approve of her bucking the trend of middle-aged moaning; instead she gets bemused smiles and what about arthritic flare-ups, memory loss and hot sweats?
Amma passes the young busker
she smiles with encouragement at the girl, who responds in kind
she fishes out a few coins, places them in the violin case
she isn’t ready to forgo cigarettes so leans on the riverside wall and lights one, hates herself for it
the adverts told her generation it would make them appear grown-up, glamorous, powerful, clever, desirable and above all, cool
no one told them it would actually make them dead
she looks out at the river as she feels the warm smoke travel down her oesophagus soothing her nerves while trying to combat the adrenaline rush of the caffeine
forty years of first nights and she’s still bricking it
what if she’s slated by the critics? dismissed with a consensus of one-star reviews, whatwas the great National thinking allowing this rubbishy impostor into the building?
of course she knows she’s not an impostor, she’s written fifteen plays and directed over forty, and as a critic once wrote, Amma Bonsu is a safe pair of hands who’s known to pull off risks
what if the preview audiences who gave standing ovations were just being kind?
oh shut up, Amma, you’re a veteran battle-axe, remember?
look
she’s got a fantastic cast: six older actresses (seen-it-all vets), six mid-careerists (survivors-so-far) and three fresh faces (naïve hopefuls), one of whom, the talented Simone, will wander in bleary-eyed to rehearsals, having forgotten to unplug the iron, turn off the stove or close her bedroom window and will waste precious rehearsal time phoning her flatmates in a panic
a couple of months ago she’d have sold her grandmother into slavery to get this job, now she’s a spoilt little prima donna who ordered her director to pop out and fetch her a caramel latte a couple of weeks ago when it was just the two of them in a rehearsal room
I’m so exhausted, Simone whinged, implying it was all Amma’s fault for making her work so hard
needless to say, she dealt with Little Miss Simone Stevenson in the moment
Little Miss Stevenson– who thinks that because she’s landed at the National straight out of drama school, she’s one step away from conquering Hollywood
she’ll find out
soon enough
at times like these Amma misses Dominique, who long ago absconded to America
they should be sharing her breakthrough career moment together
they met in the eighties at an audition for a feature film set in a women’s prison (what else?)
both were disillusioned at being put up for parts such as a slave, servant, prostitute, nanny or crim
and still not getting the job
they railed against their lot in a grotty Soho caff while devouring fried egg and bacon slathered between two slabs of soggy white bread washed down with builder’s tea alongside the sex workers who plied their trade on the streets outside
long before Soho became a trendy gay colony
look at me? Dominique said, and Amma did, there was nothing subservient, maternal or criminal about her
she wasüber-cool, totally gorgeous, taller than most women, thinner than most women, with cut-glass cheekbones and smoky eyes with thick black lashes that literally cast a shadow on her face
she wore leathers, kept her hair short except for a black fringe swept to one side, and rode about town on a battered old butcher’s bike chained up outside
can’t they see I’m a living goddess? Dominique shouted with a flamboyant gesture, flicking her fringe, adopting a sultry pose as heads turned
Amma was shorter, with African hips and thighs
perfect slave girl material one director told her when she walked into an audition for a play about Emancipation
whereupon she walked right back out again
in turn a casting director told Dominique she was wasting his time when she turned up for a Victorian drama when there weren’t any black people in Britain then
she said there were, called him ignorant before also leaving the room
and in her case, slamming the door
Amma realized she’d found a kindred spirit in Dominique who would kick arse with her
and they’d both be pretty unemployable once news got around
they went on to a local pub where the conversation continued and wine flowed
Dominique was born in the St Pauls area of Bristol to an Afro-Guyanese mother, Cecilia, who tracked her lineage back to slavery, and an Indo-Guyanese father, Wintley, whose ancestors were indentured labourers from Calcutta
the oldest of ten children who all looked more black than Asian and identified as such, especially as their father could relate to the Afro-Caribbean people he’d grown up with, but not to Indians fresh over from India
Dominique guessed her own sexual preferences from puberty, wisely kept them to herself, unsure how her friends or family would react, not wanting to be a social outcast
she tried boys a couple of times
they enjoyed it
she endured it
aged sixteen, aspiring to become an actress, she headed for London where people proudly proclaimed their outsider identities on badges
she slept rough under the Embankment arches and in shop doorways along the Strand, was interviewed by a black housing association where she lied and cried about escaping a father who’d beaten her
the Jamaican housing officer wasn’t impressed, so you got beats, is it?
Dominique escalated her complaint to one of paternal sexual abuse, was given an emergency room in a hostel; eighteen months later, after tearful weekly calls to the housing office, she landed a one-bedroom housing association flat in a small fifties block in Bloomsbury
I did what I had to find a home, she told Amma, not my finest moment, I admit, still, no harm done, as my father will never know
she went on a mission to educate herself in black history, culture, politics, feminism, discovered London’s alternative bookshops
she walked into Sisterwrite in Islington where every single author of every single book was female and browsed for hours; she couldn’t afford to buy anything, and read the whole ofHome Girls: A Black Feminist Anthology in weekly instalments, standing up, as well as anything by Audre Lorde she could get her hands on
the booksellers didn’t seem to mind
when I was accepted into a very orthodox drama school, I was already politicized and challenged them on everything, Amma
the only person of colour in the whole school
she demanded to know why the male parts in Shakespeare couldn’t be played by women and don’t even get me started on cross-racial casting, she shouted at the course director while everyone else, including the female students, stayed silent
I realized I was on my own
the next day I was taken aside by the school principal
you’re here to become an actor not a politician
you’ll be asked to leave if you keep causing trouble
you have been warned, Dominique
tell me about it, Amma replied, shut up or get out, right?
as for me, I get my fighting spirit from my dad, Kwabena, who was a journalist campaigning for Independence in Ghana
until he heard he was going to be arrested for sedition, legged it over here, ended up working on the railways where he met Mum at London Bridge station
he was a ticket collector, she worked in the offices above the concourse
he made sure to be the one to take her ticket, she made sure to be the last person to leave the train so she could exchange a few words with him
Mum, Helen, is half-caste, born in 1935 in Scotland
her father was a Nigerian student who vanished as soon as he finished his studies at the University of Aberdeen
he never said goodbye
years later her mother discovered he’d gone back to his wife and children in Nigeria
she didn’t even know he had a wife and children
Mum wasn’t the only half-caste in Aberdeen in the thirties and forties but she was rare enough to be made to feel it
she left school early, went to secretarial college, headed down to London, just as it was being populated by African men who’d come to study or work
Mum went to their dances and Soho clubs, they liked her lighter skin and looser hair
she says she felt ugly until African men told her she wasn’t
you should see what she looked like back then
a cross between Lena Horne and Dorothy Dandridge
so yeh, really ugly
Mum hoped to spend their first date going to see a film and then on to her favourite spot, Club Afrique, right here in Soho, she’d dropped enough hints and loved to dance to highlife and West African jazz
instead he took her to one of his socialist meetings in the backroom of a pub at the Elephant and Castle
where a group of men sat guzzling beers and talking independence politics
she sat there trying to act interested, impressed by his intellect
he was impressed with her silent acquiescence, if you ask me
they married and moved to Peckham
I was their last child and first girl, Amma explained, blowing smoke into the already thickening fug of the room
my three older brothers became lawyers and a doctor, their obedience to the expectations of our father meant I wasn’t pressurized to follow suit
his only concern for me is marriage and children
he thinks my acting career is a hobby until I have both
Dad’s a socialist who wants a revolution to improve the lot of all of mankind
literally
I tell Mum she married a patriarch
look at it this way, Amma, she says, your father was born male in Ghana in the 1920s whereas you were born female in London in the 1960s
and your point is?
you really can’t expect him to ‘get you’, as you put it
I let her know she’s an apologist for the patriarchy and complicit in a system that oppresses all women
she says human beings are complex
I tell her not to patronize me
Mum worked eight hours a day in paid employment, raised four children, maintained the home, made sure the patriarch’s dinner was on the table every night and his shirts were ironed every morning
meanwhile, he was off saving the world
his one domestic duty was to bring home the meat for Sunday lunch from the butcher’s – a suburban kind of hunter-gatherer thing
I can tell Mum’s unfulfilled now we’ve all left home because she spends her time either cleaning it or redecorating it
she’s never complained about her lot, or argued with him, a sure sign she’s oppressed
she told me she tried to hold his hand in the early days, but he shook her off, said affection was an English affectation, she never tried again
yet every year he gets her the soppiest Valentine card you can buy and he loves sentimental country music, sits in the kitchen on Sunday evenings listening to albums of Jim Reeves and Charley Pride
tumbler of whisky in one hand, wiping tears away with the other
Dad lives for campaigning meetings, demos, picketing Parliament and standing in Lewisham Market selling theSocialist Worker
I grew up listening to his sermons during our evening meal on the evils of capitalism and colonialism and the merits of socialism
it was his pulpit and we were his captive congregation
it was like we were literally being force-fed his politics
he’d probably be an important person in Ghana if he’d returned after Independence
instead he’s President for Life of our family
he doesn’t know I’m a dyke, are you kidding? Mum told me not to tell him, it was hard enough telling her, she said she suspected when pencil skirts and curly perms were all the rage and I started wearing men’s Levis
she’s sure it’s a phase, which I’ll throw back at her when I’m forty
Dad has no time for‘the fairies’ and laughs at all the homophobic jokes comedians make on telly every Saturday night when they’re not insulting their mother-in-law or black people
Amma spoke about going to her first black women’s group in Brixton in her last year at school, she’d seen a flyer at her local library
the woman who opened the door, Elaine, sported a perfect halo of an afro and her smooth limbs were clad tightly in light blue denim jeans and tight denim shirt
Amma wanted her on sight, followed her into the main room where women sat on sofas, chairs, cushions, cross-legged on the floor, drinking cups of coffee and cider
she nervously accepted cigarettes as they were passed around, sat on the floor leaning against a cat-mauled tweedy armchair, feeling Elaine’s warm leg against her arm
she listened as they debated what it meant to be a black woman
what it meant to be a feminist when white feminist organizations made them feel unwelcome
how it felt when people called them nigger, or racist thugs beat them up
what it was like when white men opened doors or gave up their seats on public transport for white women (which was sexist), but not for them (which was racist)
Amma could relate to their experiences, began to join in with the refrains of, we hear you, sister, we’ve all been there, sister
it felt like she was coming in from the cold
at the end of her first evening, the other women said their goodbyes and Amma offered to stay behind to wash up the cups and ashtrays with Elaine
they made out on one of the bumpy sofas in the glow of the streetlight to the accompaniment of police sirens haring by
it was the closest she’d come to making love to herself
it was another coming home
the next week when she went to the meeting
Elaine was canoodling with another woman
and blanked her completely
she never went again
Amma and Dominique stayed until they were turfed out, had worked their way through numerous glasses of red wine
they decided they needed to start their own theatre company to have careers as actors, because neither was prepared to betray their politics to find jobs
or shut their mouths to keep them
it seemed the obvious way forward
they scribbled ideas for names on hard toilet paper snaffled from the loo
Bush Women Theatre Company best captured their intentions
they would be a voice in theatre where there was silence
black and Asian women’s stories would get out there
they would create theatre on their own terms
it became the company’s motto
On Our Own Terms
or Not At All.

Living rooms became rehearsal spaces, old bangers transported props, costumes came from second-hand shops, sets were extracted from junk yards, they called on mates to help out, everyone learning on the job, ad hoc, throwing their lot in together
they wrote grant applications on old typewriters with missing keys, budgets felt as alien to Amma as quantum physics, she balked at becoming trapped behind a desk
she upset Dominique when she arrived for admin sessions late and left early claiming headaches or PMT
they rowed when she walked into a stationery shop and ran straight out again claiming it had brought on a panic attack
she had a go at Dominique when she didn’t deliver the script she’d promised to write but was out late night clubbing instead, or forgot her lines mid-show
six months after its inception, they were constantly at loggerheads
they’d hit it off as friends, only to find they couldn’t work together
Amma called a make-or-break meeting at hers
they sat down with wine and a Chinese takeaway and Dominique admitted she got more pleasure setting up tours for the company than putting herself in front of an audience, and preferred being herself to pretending to be other people
Amma admitted she loved writing, hated admin and was she really any good as an actor? she did anger brilliantly– which was the extent of her range
Dominique became the company manager, Amma the artistic director
they employed actresses, directors, designers, stage crews, set up national tours that lasted months
their plays,The Importance of Being Female,FGM: The Musical,Dis-arranged Marriage,Cunning Stunts, were performed in community centres, libraries, fringe theatres, at women’s festivals and conferences
they leafleted outside venues as audiences left and arrived, illegally plastered posters on to billboards in the dead of night
they started getting reviews in the alternative media, and even produced a monthlyBush Women samizdat
but due to pathetically poor sales and, to be honest, pathetically poor writing, it lasted for two issues after its grand launch one summer’s evening at Sisterwrite
where a group of women rolled up to enjoy the free plonk and spill out on to the pavement to light up and chat each other up

Amma supplemented her income working in a burger bar at Piccadilly Circus
where she sold hamburgers made of reconstituted cardboard topped with rehydrated onions and rubbery cheese
all of which she also ate for free in her breaks– which gave her spots
the orange nylon suit and hat she wore meant customers saw her as a uniformed servant to do their bidding
and not her wonderful, artistic, highly individualistic and rebellious self
she slipped free crusty pies filled with apple-flavoured lumps of sugar to the runaway rent boys she befriended who operated around the station
with no idea that in years to come she’d be attending their funerals
they didn’t realize unprotected sex meant a dance with death
nobody did
home was a derelict factory in Deptford with concrete walls, a collapsing ceiling and a community of rats that defeated all attempts at extermination
thereafter she moved into a series of similarly squalid squats until she found herself living in the most desirable squat in the whole of London, a Soviet-sized former office block at the back of King’s Cross
she was lucky enough to be one of the first to hear of it before it filled up
and stayed upstairs when bailiffs set a hydraulic excavator at the main door
which triggered violent countermeasures and prison sentences for the head-bangers who thought a bailiff down deserved a good kicking
they called it the Battle of King’s Cross
the building was thereafter known as the Republic of Freedomia
they were lucky, too, because the owner of the property, a certain Jack Staniforth, living tax-free in Monte Carlo, loaded from the profits of his family’s business in Sheffield cutlery, turned out to be sympathetic to their cause once news reached him from his estate holding company
he’d fought for the International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War
and a bad-investment of a building in one of London’s seediest districts was a forgettable footnote to his accounts
if they looked after the place, he wrote
they could stay for free
they stopped the illegal tapping of electricity and opened an account with the London Electricity Board
likewise with the gas, hitherto powered by a single fifty pence piece jammed into a meter
they needed to set up a management system and gathered one Saturday morning in the lobby to thrash it out
the Marxists demanded they set up a Central Committee of the Workers’ Republic of Freedomia, which was a bit rich, Amma thought, seeing as most of them had taken ‘a principled stand against the running dogs of capitalism’ as an excuse to not work
the hippies suggested they form a commune and share everything, but they were so chilled and laid back, everybody talked over them
the environmentalists wanted to ban aerosols, plastic bags and deodorant, which turned everyone against them, even the punks who weren’t exactly known for smelling minty
the vegetarians demanded a non-meat policy, the vegans wanted it extended to non-dairy, the macrobiotics suggested everyone eat steamed white cabbage for breakfast
the Rastas wanted cannabis legalized, and a reserved plot on the land out back for their Nyabinghi gatherings
the Hari Krishnas wanted everyone to join them that very afternoon banging drums down Oxford Street
the punks wanted permission to play shouty music and were duly shouted down
the gay guys wanted anti-homophobic legislation enshrined into the building’s constitution, to which everyone replied, what constitution?
the radical feminists wanted women-only quarters, self-governed by a co-op
the lesbian radical feminists wanted their own quarters away from the non-lesbian radical feminists, also self-governed by a co-op
the black radical lesbian feminists wanted the same except with the condition that no whiteys of any gender were allowed inside
the anarchists walked out because any form of governance was a betrayal of everything they believed in
Amma preferred running solo, and mixing with others who didn’t try to impose their will on anyone else
in the end a straightforward rotating management committee was formed with various rules against drug-dealing, sexual harassment and voting Tory
the plot out back became a communal space featuring scrap metal sculptures
courtesy of the artists
Amma managed to lay claim to a typing pool so large she could jog around it
with its own private toilet and sink that she kept blissfully clean and suffused with floral scents
she coated the walls and ceiling with a striking blood-red paint, ripped up the corporate-grey carpet, threw a few raffia mats on the wooden floor, installed a second-hand cooker, fridge, bean bags, a futon, and a bath reclaimed from a junk yard
her room was big enough for parties and big enough for people to crash
the disco beats of Donna Summer, Sister Sledge, Minnie Riperton and Chaka Khan swirling on vinyl got her parties going
Roberta, Sarah, Edith, Etta and Mathilde Santing were the soundtracks to her end of night seductions
behind the eighteenth-century black lacquer Chinese screen, rescued from a skip outside the old Chinese Embassy
she worked her way through many of the women of Freedomia
she wanted one-night stands, most wanted more than that
it got to the point where she dreaded passing her former conquests in the corridors, like Maryse, a translator from Guadeloupe
if she wasn’t knocking on Amma’s door in the middle of the night begging to be let in, she was lurking outside it to harass whoever was getting what she wanted
this progressed to name-calling from her window whenever she saw Amma approach the building, all of it coming to a head when she tipped a bucket of vegetable peel over Amma one day as she passed beneath her window
infuriating both the environmentalists and the management committee who took it upon themselves to write to Amma that she‘stop shitting on her own doorstep’
Amma wrote back how it was interesting that quickly people turned intototalitarian fascists once they’d been given a little power
but she’d learned her lesson and wasn’t short of attention; groupies queued up for Amma and Dominique as the main players of Bush Women Theatre
everyone from baby dykes in their late teens to women who could be their mothers
Amma didn’t discriminate, she bragged to her friends that her tastes were truly egalitarian as they traversed culture, class, creed, race, religion and generation
which, happily, gave her a bigger playing field than most
(she kept her predilection for big tits quiet because it was un-feminist to isolate body parts for sexual objectification)
Dominique was more selective and monogamous, serially so, she went for actresses, usually blonde, whose microscopic talent was overshadowed by their macroscopic beauty
or models whose lookswere their talent
women-only bars were their hangouts
Fallen Angel, Rackets, the Bell, the Drill Hall Theatre bar on a Monday where the lesbianarati hung out, and Pearl’s shebeen in Brixton on a Friday night run by Pearl, a middle-aged Jamaican woman who stripped her basement of furniture, set up a sound system and charged at the door
Amma experienced commitment to one person as imprisonment, she hadn’t left home for a life of freedom and adventure to end up chained to another person’s desires
if she slept with a woman more than two or three times, they usually went from attractively independent to increasingly needy
within the space of aweek
she’d become their sole source of happiness as they moved to assert their authority over her autonomy, by any means necessary
sulks, tears, accusations of selfishness and heartlessness
Amma learnt to head all women off, to state her intentions upfront, to never sleep with the same person twice, or pushing it, thrice
even when she wanted to
sex was a simple, harmless, human pleasure and until her late thirties she got a lot of it
how many were there? one hundred, another fifty? surely not more than that?
a couple of friends suggested she try therapy to help her settle down, she replied she was practically a virgin compared to male rock stars who boasted conquests of thousands and were admired for it
did anyone tell them to go and get psychoanalysed?
unfortunately one or two of her earlier conquests have been harassing her on social media of late where the past is just waiting to smack you in the face
like the woman who posted that Amma had been her first when they slept together thirty-five years ago and had been so trashed she vomited all over her
it was so traumatic I never got over it, she wailed
or the woman who chased her up Regent Street shouting at her for not returning her calls from around the same time
who do you think you are, you pretentious show-off theatre luvvie? you’re nothing, that’s what you are,nothing
you must be off your meds, love, Amma shouted back, before escaping into the subterranean warren of Topshop
Amma long ago lost interest in bed-hopping; over time she began to crave the intimacy that comes from being emotionally, although not exclusively, close to another person
non-monogamous relationships are her thing, or is it called polyamory now? as Yazz describes it, which as far as she can tell is non-monogamy in all but name,child
there’s Dolores, a graphic designer based in Brighton, and Jackie, an occupational therapist in Highgate
they’ve been in the picture seven and three years respectively and are both independent women who have full lives (and children) outside of their relationship with her
they’re not clingy or needy or jealous or possessive, and they actually like each other so yes, sometimes they indulge in a little ménage à trois
upon occasion
(Yazz would be horrified if she knew this)
the middle-aged Amma sometimes feels nostalgic for her younger days, remembers the only time she and Dominique went on a pilgrimage to the legendary Gateways
hidden down a Chelsea basement in the last years of its fifty-year existence
it was almost empty, two middle-aged women stood at the bar wearing men’s haircuts and suits and looking as if they’d walked straight out of the pages ofThe Well of Loneliness
the dance floor was dimly lit, and two very old and very small women, one in a black suit, the other in a forties-style dress, danced cheek-to-cheek to Dusty Springfield singing‘The Look of Love’
and there wasn’t even a glittery disco ball spinning from the middle of the ceiling, sprinkling stardust on to them.

Amma throws her coffee in a bin and walks directly towards the theatre, past the concrete skateboarding area emblazoned with graffiti
it’s way too early for the youngsters to begin their death-defying leaps and twists without helmets or protective knee pads
the young, who are so fearless
like Yazz, who goes out cycling without a helmet
who storms off when her mother tells her that wearing a helmet might be the difference between
a/ getting a headache
b/ learning to talk again
she enters the stage door, greets the security guard, Bob, who wishes her well for tonight, makes her way through the corridors and up the stairs and eventually on to the cavernous stage
she looks out at the empty, auditory wilderness of the fan-shaped auditorium, modelled on the Greek amphitheatres that ensured everyone in the audience had an uninterrupted view of the action
over a thousand people will fill the seats this very evening
so many people gathered to see her production is quite unbelievable
the entire run almost sold out before a single review has been filed
how’s that for demand for something quite different?
The Last Amazon of Dahomey, written and directed by Amma Bonsu
where in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries women warriors served the king
women who lived in the king’s compound and were supplied with food and female slaves
who left the palace preceded by a slave girl ringing a bell warning men to look away or be killed
who became the palace guard because men couldn’t be trusted not to chop off the king’s head or castrate him with a cutlass while he slept
who were trained to climb naked over thorny acacia branches to toughen up
who were sent into the hazardous forest for nine days to survive on their own
who were crack shots with muskets and could behead and disembowel their enemies with ease
who fought the Yoruba next door and the French who came to colonize
who grew to an army of six thousand, all formally married to the king
who were not otherwise permitted sexual relations and any male child born to them was killed off
on first hearing about this Amma decided they must have been at it among themselves because wasn’t that the case when the sexes are segregated?
and the idea of her play was born
the last Amazon is Nawi, who enters the stage as a vulnerable teenage bride presented to the king; unable to bear his child, she’s cast out of his bedchamber and forced to join his female combat troops where she survives the hazardous induction and rises up the ranks through her powerful physicality and cunning battle strategies to become a legendary Amazon general who shocked foreign observers with her fearless ferocity
Amma shows Nawi’s loyalty to her many women lovers long after she tires of them, making sure the king assigns them lightweight domestic duties rather than kick them out of the compound to a life of destitution
at the end of the play, old and alone, Nawi reconnects with her past lovers, who fade in and out as spectres, courtesy of holograms
she relives the wars where she made her name, including the ones the king instigated to provide captors for the abolished slave trade in the Americas, with outlaw slave ships outrunning the blockades in order to do business with him
she’s proud of her achievements
video projections show her battles in action, thunderous armies of charging Amazons brandishing muskets and machetes
hollering and swelling towards the audience
spine-chilling, terrifying
in the end
there is Nawi’s death
lights slowly fading
to blackout
Amma wishes Dominique could have flown over to see a play she was the first to read ten years ago when Amma wrote it
a play that’s taken this long to get staged because every company she sent it to turned it down as not being right for them
and she couldn’t bear the thought of resurrecting Bush Women Theatre to put it on
when Dominique left, she was left to steer the battleship alone
which she did for a few years, feeling abandoned, never finding someone to replace Dominique who had provided the practical solutions to Amma’s creative ideas
she dismantled the company in the end
and went freelance
Shirley
her oldest friend will be here tonight, she’s attended every one of Amma’s shows since she was a teenager, has been a constant in her life since they met as eleven-year-olds at grammar school when Shirley, the only other brown girl in the school, made a beeline for her in the playground when Amma was standing alone one lunchtime amid the excitement of green-uniformed girls screeching and whooping and having fun skipping with ropes and playing hopscotch and games of tag
there was Shirley standing before her
Shirley, with perfectly straightened hair, her face so shiny (Vaseline, Amma later discovered), with her perfectly-knotted school tie, white socks pulled up to her knees
so composed, so neat, so nice-looking
unlike Amma’s own messy hair, mainly because she was unable to stop unpicking the two braids her mother plaited for her every morning
or stop her socks slipping down to her ankles because she couldn’t help rubbing one foot against the other leg
and her school cardigan was three sizes too big because her mother had made it to last three years
hello, she said, my name’s Shirley, do you want me to be your friend?
Amma nodded, Shirley took her hand and led her to the group she’d just left who were playing rubber band skipping
they were inseparable after that, Shirley paid attention in class and could be relied on to help out with homework
Shirley listened for hours to Amma talking about the crushes she had on boys, and later, after a transitional bisexual period (with brief crushes on Shirley’s brothers Errol and Tony), girls
Shirley never had a negative word to say about her sexuality, covered for her when she bunked off school and listened avidly to her tales from the youth theatre– the smoking, snogging, drinking, acting – in that order, even when their paths forked after school, Shirley into teaching, Amma into theatre, they maintained their friendship
and even when Amma’s arty friends said Shirley was the dullest person on the planet and did she have to inviteher? Amma stood up for Shirley’s ordinariness
she’s a good person, she protested
Shirley babysat Yazz whenever she was asked (Amma also babysat Shirley’s girls once or twice, maybe?)
Shirley never once complained when Amma needed to borrow money to pay off her debts, which she sometimes wrote off as birthday presents
it felt one-way for a long time, until Amma reasoned she made Shirley’s safe and predictable life more interesting and scintillating
andthat was what she gave back
then there were the members of her group orsquad, as Yazz corrects her, no one says group of friends, Mum, it’s so, like, prehistoric?
she misses the people they used to be, when they were all discovering themselves with no idea how much they might change in the years to come
her group came to her opening nights, were at the end of a phone (landline, of course– howdid that work back then?) for a spontaneous night out
were there to share and stir-up dramas
Mabel was a freelance photographer who went straight once she hit her thirties, ditched all her lesbian friends as part of her reinvention as probably the first black, Barbour-wearing, horse-riding housewife in the Shires
Olivine went from being un-castable in Britain because she was so dark to landing a major crime series in Hollywood and living the life of a star with ocean views and glossy magazine spreads
Katrina was a nurse who returned to Aberdeen where she belonged, she said, became a born-again Anglophile, married Kirsty, a doctor, and refuses to come down to London
Lakshmi will be here tonight, a saxophonist who composed for their shows, before deciding there was nothing worse than a song and a tune and began to put the niche into avant garde and play what Amma privately thinks of as bing-bang-bong music, usually headlining weird festivals in remote fields with more cows than punters in attendance
Lakshmi has also developed an improbable guru persona for the gullible students she tutors at music college
who gather around the hearth of her council flat sipping cheap cider from tea cups
while she sits cross-legged on the sofa in flowing robes, long hair streaked with silver
denouncing chord progressions in favour of micro-tonal improvisation and poly-tempic, poly-rhythmic and multi-phonic structures and effects
while declaring that composition is dead, girls and boys
I’m all about the contemporary extemporary
even though Lakshmi is approaching sixty, her chosen lover, male or female, remains in the 25–35 age range, at the upper end of which the relationship ends
when Amma calls her on it, she comes up with a reasonother than that they’re no longer quite so impressionable, fresh-faced and taut-skinned
then there was Georgie, the only one who didn’t survive into the nineties
a plumber’s apprentice from Wales, she was abandoned by her Jehovah’s Witness family for being gay
she became the lost orphan child they all took under their wing
the only woman in a council’s plumbing team, she had to endure constant innuendo from her male colleagues with their jokes about screw hole locators, blow bags, nipples and ballcocks
as well as comments on what they’d like to do with her arse when she was fixing something under a sink or peering down a gutter
Georgie
drank two litres of Coca Cola a day and mixed it with spirits and drugs at night
she was the least lucky of their group in attracting women, and sadly, stupidly, thought she’d be on her own forever
many a night out ended in tears with Georgie saying she was too ugly to pull, which wasn’t true, they all endlessly reassured her how attractive she was, although Amma considered her more Artful Dodger than Oliver Twist
which in the lesbian world wasn’t such a bad thing
Amma can never forget the last time she saw her, both of them sitting on the kerb outside the Bell as the revellers drifted drunkenly off while Amma forced a finger down Georgie’s throat to make her regurgitate the pills she’d taken in the toilets
for the first time in their friendship, Amma actually showed her frustration with her friend for being such a hopeless case, for being so insecure, for not being able to cope with adulthood, for getting off her face all the time, it’s time to grow up, Georgie, it’s time to grow the fuck up!
a week later she went over the top floor balcony on the Pepys Estate in Deptford where she lived
to this day, Amma wonders how Georgie died
did she fall (accident), fly (tripping), throw herself off (suicide) or was she pushed (unlikely)
she still feels guilty, still wonders if it was her fault
Sylvester always shows up on first nights, if only for the free booze at the after-party
even though a few days ago he accused her of selling out when he cornered her outside Brixton tube station on her way home from rehearsal
and persuaded her to have a drink with him at the Ritzy where they sat in the upstairs bar surrounded by posters of the independent films they’d been going to see together since they first met as students at drama school
films likePink Flamingos, starring the great drag queen, Divine,Born in Flames,Daughters of the Dust,Farewell My Concubine, Pratibha Parmar’sA Place of Rage andHandsworth Songs by the Black Audio Film Collective
films that inspired her own aesthetics as a theatre-maker
although she’s never admitted her equally lowbrow tastes to Sylvester, who’s too much of a political purist to understand
such as her addictions toDynasty andDallas, the original series and their recent incarnations
orAmerica’s Top Model orMillionaire Matchmaker orBig Brother
and the rest…
Amma looked around the bar at the other alternatives who’d moved into Brixton when it was crime-addled but affordable
these people were her people, they’d lived through two riots and were proud of their multiracial social circles and bloodlines, like Sylvester, who’d gone on a pilgrimage here to visit the gay community centre that came and went and met the man who became his life partner, Curwen, newly arrived from St Lucia
they used to make such a striking couple
Sylvester, or Sylvie, was then blond and pretty, he spent most of the eighties wearing dresses, his long hair flowing down his back
he was out to challenge society’s gender expectations, long before the current trend, he’s taken to complaining,I was there first
Curwen, freckled and light brown, might wear a turban, kilt, lederhosen and full make-up
when he felt like it
to challenge various other expectations
he said
Sylvester’s now grey, balding, bearded, and is never seen in anything other than a threadbare Chinese worker’s suit
which he claims is an original from eBay
whereas Curwen wears a retro donkey jacket and denim dungarees
two young men sat at the table next to them, awkward and incongruous with their office haircuts, smooth cheeks, crisp suits, polished shoes
Amma and Sylvester exchanged looks, they hated the interlopers who were colonizing the neighbourhood, who patronized the chi-chi eateries and bars that now replaced a stretch of the indoor market previously known for stalls selling parrot fish, yam, ackee, Scotch bonnet peppers, African materials, weaves, Dutch pots, giant Nigerian land snails and pickled green eggs from China
these upmarket places also employed security guards to keep the locals out
because while their clientele loved slumming it in SW2 or SW9
they couldn’t hide the fact that SW1 and SW3 were in their DNA
Sylvester was very active in the Keep Brixton Real Campaign
he’d lost none of his revolutionary zeal
which wasn’t necessarily a good thing
Amma sipped her seventh coffee of the day, this one laced with Drambuie, while Sylvester slugged beer from a bottle, the only way a revolutionary should drink it, according to him
he still ran his socialist theatre company, The 97%, which toured to fringe venues and‘hard-to-reach communities’, which she should alsostill be doing
Amma, you should be taking your plays to community centres and libraries, not to the middle-class bastards at the National
she replied that the last time she took a show to a library, the audience was mainly made up of homeless people who were sleeping at best, snoring at worst
it was about fifteen years ago, she vowed never to again
social inclusion is more important than success, or should it be calledsick-cess? Sylvester replied, and Amma couldn’t convince him she was right to move on to bigger things as he kept knocking back the beersshe paid for (well, you must be earning a lot now you’ve hit the big time)
she argued it was her right to be directing at the National and it was the theatre’s job to make sure they attracted audiences beyond the middle-class day-trippers from the Home Counties, reminding him this included his parents, a retired banker and homemaker from Berkshire, who came to London for its culture, parents who supported him, even when he came out as a teenager
he’d once let slip while drunk that he got a monthly allowance
(she was far too nice to ever remind him of this)
the thing is, she said, while troublemaking on the periphery’s all well and good, we also have to make a difference inside the mainstream, we all pay taxes that fund these theatres, right?
Sylvester offered up the smug expression of a tax-dodging outlaw
at least I donow, she said, and youshould
he sat back, his eyes watery from the beers, silently judging her, she knew that look, the drink was about to bring out a viciousness otherwise absent from her good friend
admit it, Ams, you’ve dropped your principles for ambition and you’re now establishment with a capital E, he said, you’re a turncoat
she stood up, gathered up her African print patchwork bag and left the premises
a little further down the high street she looked back and saw him leaning against the wall of the Ritzy rolling up a cigarette
still rolling up
you stay there, Sylvie.

Amma walked to her house in the dark, still grateful she’d become a homeowner so late in life, at a time when she was practically homeless
first of all Jack Staniforth died and his son Jonathan, who’d been chomping at the bit for years at his father’s simply scandalous decision not to financially capitalize on the King’s Cross regeneration scheme that would one day run trains direct from London to Paris
gave the Citizens of Freedomia three months’ notice
devastated, Amma nonetheless had to admit she’d had a spectacularly good run as she’d never paid a single copper penny in rent in what had become one of the most expensive cities on the planet
she cried when she left her former office with its jogging sized dimensions and windows overlooking the trains that rolled into the station from the north of England
she couldn’t afford commercial rents and wasn’t eligible for subsidized housing
Amma sofa surfed until she was offered someone’s spare room
she’d come full circle
then her mother died, devoured from the inside by the ruthless, ravenous, carnivorous disease that started off with one organ before moving on to destroy the others
Amma saw it as symptomatic and symbolic of her mother’s oppression
Mum never found herself, she told friends, she accepted her subservient position in the marriage and rotted from the inside
she could barely look at her father at the funeral
not long after, he too died of heart failure in his sleep; Amma believed he’d willed it upon himself because he couldn’t live without her mother, who’d propped him up since his early days in England
she surprised herself at the strength of her grief
she then regretted never telling him she loved him, he was her father, a good man, of course she loved him, she knew that now he was gone, he was a patriarch but her mother was right when she said, he’s of his time and culture, Amma
my father was devastated at having to flee Ghana so abruptly, she eulogized at his memorial, attended by his elderly socialist comrades
it must have been so traumatic, to lose his home, his family, his friends, his culture, his first language, and to come to a country that didn’t want him
once he had children, he wanted us educated in England and that was it
my father believed in the higher purpose of left-wing politics and actively worked to make the world a better place
she didn’t tell them she’d taken her father for granted and carried her blinkered, self-righteous perspective of him from childhood through to his death, when in fact he’d done nothing wrong except fail to live up to her feminist expectations of him
she had been a selfish, stupid brat, now it was too late
he’d toldher he loved her, every year on her birthday when her mother was alive, when he signed the card she bought and sent for him
her successful older brothers kindly gave her the greatest share of the family home in Peckham
which paid for a substantial deposit on a small terraced house with a box garden in Railton Road, Brixton
a place to call her own.

Yazz
was born nineteen years ago in a birthing pool in Amma’s candle-lit living room
surrounded by incense, the music of lapping waves, a doulaand midwife, Shirley and Roland– her great friend, who’d agreed to father her child when the death of her parents triggered an unprecedented and all-consuming broodiness
luckily for her, Roland, five years into his partnership with Kenny, had also been thinking about fatherhood
he took Yazz every other weekend, as agreed, which Amma regretted when she found herself missing her newborn instead of feeling deliriously free from Friday afternoons to Sunday evenings
Yazz was the miracle she never thought she wanted, and having a child really did complete her, something she rarely confided because it somehow seemed anti-feminist
Yazz was going to be her countercultural experiment
she breastfed her wherever she happened to be, and didn’t care who was offended at a mother’s need to feed her child
she took her everywhere, strapped to her back or across her front in a sling, deposited her in the corner of rehearsal rooms, or on the table at meetings
she took her on tour on trains and planes in a travel cot that looked more like a carry-all, once almost sending her through the airport scanner, begging them not to arrest her over it
she created the position of seven godmothers and two godfathers
to ensure there’d be a supply of babysitters for when her child was no longer quite so compliant and portable
Yazz was allowed to wear exactly what she liked so long as she wasn’t endangering herself or her health
she wanted her to be self-expressed before they tried to crush her child’s free spirit through the oppressive regimentation of the education system
she has a photo of her daughter walking down the street wearing a plastic Roman army breastplate over an orange tutu, white fairy wings, a pair of yellow shorts over red and white stripy leggings, a different shoe on each foot (a sandal and a welly), lipstick smudged on her lips, cheeks and forehead (a phase), and her hair tied into an assortment of bunches with miniature dolls hanging off the ends
Amma ignored the pitying or judgemental looks from passers-by and small-minded mothers at the playground or nursery
Yazz was never told off for speaking her mind, although she was told off for swearing because she needed to develop her vocabulary
(Yazz, say you find Marissa unpleasant or unlikeable rather than describing her as a shit-faced smelly bottom)
and although she didn’t always get what she wanted, if she argued her case strongly enough, she was in with a chance
Amma wanted her daughter to be free, feminist and powerful
later she took her on personal development courses for children to give her the confidence and articulacy to flourish in any setting
big mistake
Mum, Yazz said at fourteen when she was pitching to go to Reading Music Festival with her friends, it would be to the detriment of my juvenile development if you curtailed my activities at this critical stage in my journey towards becoming the independent-minded and fully self-expressed adult you expect me to be, I mean, do you really want me rebelling against your old-fashioned rules by running away from the safety of my home to live on the streets and having to resort to prostitution to survive and thereafter drug addiction, crime, anorexia and abusive relationships with exploitative bastards twice my age before my early demise in a crack house?
Amma fretted the whole weekend her little girl was away
adult men had been ogling her daughter since before puberty
there are a lot more paedophiles out there than people realize
a year later Yazz was calling her a feminazi when she was on her way out to a party and Amma dared suggest she lower her skirt and heels and raise the scoop neck of her top so that at least 30% of her body mass was covered, as opposed to the 20% currently given a decency rating
not to mentionThe Boyfriend, glimpsed when he dropped her off in his car
as soon as Yazz was in the door, Amma was waiting in the hallway to ask her the sort of harmless question any parent would ask
who is he and what does he do? hoping Yazz would say he was in the sixth form, a relatively harmless schoolboy then
Yazz replied with dead-pan insolence, Mum, he’s a thirty-year-old psychopath who abducts vulnerable women and locks them in a cellar for weeks on end while he has his wicked way with them before chopping them into pieces and sticking them in the freezer for his winter stews
before waltzing upstairs to her room leaving a whiff of whacky-backy
nor is the child she raised to be a feminist calling herself one lately
feminism is so herd-like, Yazz told her, to be honest, even being a woman is passé these days, we had a non-binary activist at uni called Morgan Malenga who opened my eyes, I reckon we’re all going to be non-binary in the future, neither male nor female, which are gendered performances anyway, which means yourwomen’s politics, Mumsy, will become redundant, and by the way, I’m humanitarian, which is on a much higher plane than feminism
do you even know what that is?
Amma misses her daughter now she’s away at university
not the spiteful snake that slithers out of her tongue to hurt her mother, because in Yazz’s world young people are the only ones with feelings
but she misses the Yazz who stomps about the place
who rushes in as if a hurricane’s just blown her into a room – where’s my bag/phone/bus pass/books/ticket/head?
the familiar background sounds when she’s around, the click of the bathroom door when she’s in it, even though it’s just the two of them in the house, a habit begun at puberty which Amma finds affronting
the exactly ten crunches of the pepper mill over the (canned!) tomato or mushroom soup that she prefers to Amma’s lovely homemade ones
the murmur of music and radio chatter coming from her bedroom in the morning
the sight of her daughter curled up on the sofa under a duvet in the living room on Saturdays, watching television, until she’s ready to go out at midnight
Amma can just about remember that she too used to go out late and return home on the morning bus
the house breathes differently when Yazz isn’t there
waiting for her to return and create some noise and chaos
she hopes she comes home after university
most of them do these days, don’t they?
they can’t afford otherwise
Yazz can stay forever
really.
Yazz

Yazz
sits on the seat chosen by Mum in the middle of the stalls, one of the best in the house, although she’d rather be hidden away at the back in case the play is another embarrassment
she’s tied her amazingly wild, energetic, strong and voluminous afro back because people sitting behind her in venues complain they can’t see the stage
when her afro’d compatriots accuse people of racism or microaggressions for this very reason, Yazz asks them how they’d feel if an unruly topiary hedge blocked their view of the stage at a concert?
two members of her uni squad, the Unfuckwithables, are seated either side of her, Waris and Courtney, hard workers like her because they’re all determined to get good degrees because without it they’re
stuffed
they’re all stuffed anyway, they agree
when they leave uni it’s gonna be with a huge debt and crazy competition for jobs and the outrageous rental prices out there mean her generation will have to move back homeforever, which will lead to even more of them despairing at the future and what with the planet about to go to shit with the United Kingdom soon to be disunited from Europe which itself is hurtling down the reactionary road and making fascism fashionable again and it’s so crazy that the disgusting perma-tanned billionaire has set a new intellectual and moral low by being president of America and basically it all means that the older generation has RUINED EVERYTHING and her generation is doooooomed
unless they wrest intellectual control from their elders
sooner rather than later
Yazz is reading English Literature and plans to be a journalist with her own controversial column in a globally-read newspaper because she has a lot to say and it’s about time the whole world heard her
Waris from Wolverhampton, seated to her right, is reading Politics and wants to become a Member of Parliament, tore-pre-sent, and will go down the community activism route first,à la Barack ‘Major Role Model’ Obama
Come Back Barack!
Courtney from Suffolk, seated to her left, is reading American Studies because she’s really into African-American men, and she chose her course because of the option to study in the States for her third year where she hopes to pick up a husband
the theatre is predominated by the usual greyheads (average age one hundred)
Mum’s friends and diehard fans are dotted all over, they should be grey but are more likely to shave it off, dye it or cover it up with head-wraps
she looks over at Sylvester, slumped in his seat, scruffy as hell in his tatty blue‘Communist China’ overalls, his beard makes him look more like an Amish farmer than an urban hipster
way too old for it, Sylvie
his arms are crossed and he’s scowling like he really wants tonot enjoy the play before it’s even begun, when he notices her ogling him, puts on a smiley face and waves, probably embarrassed that she’s read his mind
she waves too, putting her nice-to-see-you-face back on
he’s one of her godfathers, but was demoted to the C List when he sent her the same birthday card three years in a row – a cheap recycled charity one at that, as for birthday presents, he stopped them when she turned sixteen, as if she had no need for financial support once she could legally havesex
the A List goddies part with money, lots of it, every year on her birthday, they’re the best as they really want to keep in with her as their conduit to the younger generation
a couple of goddies have disappeared altogether on account of falling out with Mum over some pointless melodrama
Mum says Sylvester should stop sniping at other people’s success (hers) and that as he won’t change with the times, he’s been left behind
you mean the way you felt not so long ago, Mum?
ever since she landed the National gig she’s got very snooty about struggling theatre mates, as if she alone has discovered the secret to being successful
as if she hasn’t spent way too many years of her life watching crap television while waiting for the phone to ring
this is the problem with having a daughter with X-ray vision
she can see through the parental bullshit
Uncle Curwen isn’t with Sylvester tonight because he believes politics is way more dramatic than anything on stage at a theatre: ‘Brexit& Trumpquake!– behold the comedy of errors of our time’ being his latest mantra
as a Lambeth Labour councillor, he’s usually at meetings firefighting, or as Sylvester counteracts, causing them, because he likes to drag the carpet from underneath Curwen’s political self-importance
who needs enemies when your life partner undermines you on a regular basis?
Curwen uses antiquated expressions like‘right on’ and likes to keep it real by frequenting the dingiest pub in Brixton where the old timers sit around still moaning about Maggie Thatcher and the Miners’ strike, one of the few pubs that haven’t been turned into a wine bar, gastro-pub or champagne bar, as Mum whinges
as if she herself wasn’t part of the gentrification of Brixton years ago
as if she herself isn’t a frequenter of the artsy hotspots like the Ritzy
as if she herself didn’t take Yazz to one of the very champagne bars she supposedly scorns to celebrate passing her ‘A’ levels a year early
just this once, Mum whispered as they entered the part of the indoor market that’s now frequented by posh banker types who looked at them as they walked down the lane between bars as if they were looking at natives on their cultural safari
yet who was it who was spotted at the Cereal Lovers Café in Stockwell by one of Yazz’s mates not so long ago?
a café that specializes in selling over a hundred types of breakfast cereal at extortionate prices
a café that only those who’ve truly sold their souls to Hipster Hell would even think of venturing into
a café that’s so outraged the locals they keep smashing the windows in
as for Dad
(you can call me Roland, no, you’re my dad,Dad)
he’s sitting a couple of rows in front of her, wearing one of his Ozwald Boateng suits – brilliant blue on the outside, purple satin on the inside
his head is shiny, thanks to cocoa butter first thing in the morning, last thing at night
he’s straight-backed, thanks to monthly Alexander Technique sessions to counteract what he calls academic hunchback syndrome
every so often he casually glances around to see who’s recognized him off the telly
Dad’s budget in clothes could pay her university fees for a year, the very fees hesays he can’t afford
it’s his thing, prioritizing fashion over the self-sacrifice of proper fatherhood
hers is rummaging through his stuff in search of the large denomination banknotes he leaves in his jacket pockets in his walk-in wardrobe in the (four-storey) house on Clapham Common with its white wooden flooring, yellow walls and the original Cartier-Bresson photographs he chanced upon in a car boot sale in Wembley when he was a teenager and bought for a pound each
as he boasts to all first-time visitors when they walk past them in the entrance hallway
it’s also probably fair to say she was probablytoo young at thirteen to innocently open the drawer under his bed and come across a leather gas mask type thing with a leather dick attached where she presumed a nose should be, along with associated whips, gels, handcuffs and other unexplainable objects
unfortunately, once seen, never unseen and it was a lesson for her at a young age that you never know people until you’ve been through their drawers
and computer history
Dad
the author of theNew York Times andSunday Times bestselling trilogy:How We Lived Then (2000),How We Live Now (2008), andHow We Will Live in the Future (2014)
Dr Roland Quartey, the country’s first Professor of Modern Life at the University of London
really?all of it, Dad? she asked him when he told her proudly on the phone about his latest professorial number
isn’t that, like, a bit of a tall order? don’t you have to be an expert on everything in a world that encompasses over seven billion people and like about two hundred countries and thousands of languages and cultures
isn’t that more likeGod’s purview? tell me, are you God now, Dad? I meanofficially?
he mumbled stuff about the Internet of Things and Pokémon, terrorism and global politics,Breaking Bad andGame of Thrones and then threw in quotes he attributed to Derrida and Heidegger for good measure, which he always does when he can’t handle a tricky situation
what about bell hooks? she shot back, quickly scrolling down the reading list for her‘Gender, Race and Class’ module on her phone
what about Kwame Anthony Appiah, Judith Butler, Aimé Césaire, Angela Davis, Simone de Beauvoir, Frantz Fanon, Julia Kristeva, Audre Lorde, Edward Said, Gayatri Spivak, Gloria Steinem, V. Y. Mudimbe, Cornel West and the rest?
Dad didn’t reply
he wasn’t expecting this, the student outwitting the master (grasshopper rocks!)
I mean, how on earth can you be a Professor of Modern Life when your terms of reference are all male, and actually all-white (even when you’re not, she refrained from adding)
when he eventually spoke, his voice was choked, his car had arrived (not cab), he had to dash off
if true, the car (car = limo and cab = taxi) would be to chauffeur him to a television studio because he regularly pops up on the telly to have arguments with people even more arrogant than himself
he’s become a media-whore, Mum opines disapprovingly, he was such a great guy before he became famous and was corrupted by celebrity, he used to believe in something, now he only believes in himself, your father is very establishment, Yazz, that’s why they lionize him, he’s not an outsider likeme, trying to get a foot in the door and being given crumbs, Yazz,crumbs
funnily enough, when Mum watches him on the telly, she begrudgingly agrees with pretty much everything he says, and she can’t say she’s an outsider now she’s on at the National
Dad did an epic sulk after Yazz’s epic take-down
he couldn’t have her to stay for that weekend or the next or the next
deadlines-deadlines-deadlines, you know how it is?
the thing is, if she and her father are going to have a healthy relationship into the future, it’s up to her to keep him in check because no one else is going to do it, he surrounds himself with what Mum calls his ‘court sycophants’, the people Yazz meets at his parties, mainly famous white people off the telly who see him as an honorary one of them
she’s almost got there with Mum, although it was a hard slog, especially when she was fourteen or fifteen and Mum was prone to hysteria when she didn’t get her own way
now she knows better than to try to control or contradict her daughter
all Yazz needs to say these days is, don’t sass me, Mumsy! and she shuts up
Dad’s on that learning curve too
he’ll thank her in the end
Kenny (Godfather Number Two, who wisely gives her birthday cheques starringtwo zeros) is sitting loyally next to Dad
Kenny’s also bald and mustachioed in a 1970s way (not good), he’s a landscape gardener and she and him get along mainly because he has no delusions about his own greatness, they’ll watchX Factor together just for the sake of it, whereas Dad will pretend it’s because he’s going to write about its cultural significance
they go out riding their bikes very early on a Sunday morning before the city wakes up, across the common to Battersea, down the backstreets to Richmond and the river, for the pure enjoyment of it, not because it’s enforced exercise to stay slim
which is the only reason Dad runs marathons
Kenny did ask her to be a bit less negative towards Dad the other day after he’d gone upstairs in a huff over a harmless comment she’d made
Yazz replied she was going through her cynical late teenage years, I just can’t help it, Kenny, once I come out all lovable again on the other side, I’ll let you know
Kenny cracked up at that, he likes to remind her he’s known her since she was a sperm among millions in Dad’s test tube and when Mum used to complain she was giving her a good kicking inside her womb
to which she quipped back that it was because she had an embryonic premonition she was going to be born into poverty
once she’s graduated and working, she’s going to persuade Mum to sell her house, correction,their house, which is now worth a fortune thanks toMum’s gentrification of Brixton
Mum can downsize to a bungalow, which will be very practical for a woman her age, probably in one of the unfashionable seaside towns where they’ll be cheaper
with the money left over from the sale of the house, Yazz can buy a small flat
a one-bedroom will do for now
helping me on to the property ladder will be the defining act of your life, Mumsy
she didn’t reply
Yazz wishes the play had already opened to five-star universal acclaim so that she can watch it stamped with pre-approval, it matters becauseshe’ll have to deal with the aftermath if it’s slagged off by the critics and Mum’ll go on an emotional rampage that might last weeks – about the critics sabotaging her career with their complete lack of insight into black women’s lives and how this had been her big break after over forty years of hard graft blah di blah and how theydidn’tget the play because it’s not about aid workers in Africa or troubled teenaged boys or drug dealers or African warlords or African-American blues singers or white people rescuing black slaves
guess who’ll have to be on the end of the phone to pick up the pieces?
she’s Mum’s emotional caretaker, always has been, always will be
it’s the burden of being an only child, especially a girl
who will naturally be more caring.

Yazz has a massive poster of Hendrix in her room at uni with his crazy hair, hippy headband, rippled chest, bulging crotch and electric guitar
a cultural signifier for all those who enter her room to instantly know what kinda badass they dealin’ wiv
although her eclectic and unpredictable taste extends beyond the electric rock riffs of prehistory to A$AP Rocky to Mozart to Stormzy to the Priests to Angélique Kidjo to Wizkid to Bey to Chopin to RiRi to Scott Joplin to Dolly Parton to Amr Diab and so on
she’s even got a recording of the über basso profundo Oktavist singers of Russia who don’t so much sing as make the earth rumble
so much radness and who’s way ahead of da mob dem?
her room is the largest in her block on account of the‘extreme claustrophobia and social anxiety’ stunt she pulled to get it
it overlooks the canal that runs along the border of the campus through to the wetlands beyond with its otters (or is it badgers?) and herons (or is it geese?) and other birdy, animalistic things she doesn’t recognize and can’t be bothered to look up
she’d rather fill her head with stuff that will help her get on in life and naming the wildlife of eastern England don’t come into it
the other side of her room overlooks the pathways that zig-zag through the campus, from which a stream of caners stagger past her window to their rooms most nights, usually drunk and selfishly loud, having been drinking in town or in the Student Union bar
she’s only been in it once as it was crammed with the drunken dregs of humanity, i.e. the type of boys who get progressively malodorous as the term progresses because their mother isn’t dunking them screaming into a bath every night
the kind of boys who wear increasingly injured expressions because they don’t understand why no one will sit next to them in lectures and no one wants to tell them, yo, you stink, bro
Yazz thought she’d find romance at uni, a nice guy on her level who doesn’t look like the back of a bus and is taller than her (prerequisite)
someone to snuggle up to on Saturday evenings and to laze away Sunday mornings in bed listening to music while she catches up with theNew Yorker,Observer,gal-dem,The Root,Atlantic andthegrio
because one day she will write for them
sadly, Mum has more pulling power than her and is actually considered hot in the lesbian world
her girlfriendsdu jour, as Dad puts it (hey, why speak English when you can speak French?), are two white women, Dolores and Jackie, although Mum has been with every ethnicity known to humankind (it’s called multiracial whoredom)
they’re all very cosy together which is quite heart-warming seeing as Mum’s women have gone to war over her
it’s strange, and suspicious, because with Dolores and Jackie there are no screaming matches, no ranting answerphone messages, no one trying to kick in the front door in the middle of the night, and no one skulking in a corner looking daggers at her rival at Mum’s parties
it’s like they actually like each other, Yazz suspects they have gruesome threesomes, and can’t bring herself to ask
besides, she’s lost count of the women who’ve come and gone to the point that the new ones barely register on her Richter scale of annoyance
there’ll inevitably be a new face around the breakfast table trying to befriend the daughter of their new lover, running around making her toast, omelette with cheese and tomatoes, pouring her juice, washing up the dishes after her
the daughter who’ll drop numerous unsubtle hints when her birthday/Christmas/Easter are approaching
(and why isn’t the marmalade on the table?)
when Yazz talks about her unusual upbringing to people, the unworldly ones expect her to be emotionally damaged from it, like how can you not be when your mum’s a polyamorous lesbian and your father’s a gay narcissist (as she describes him), and you were shunted between both their homes and dumped with various godparents while your parents pursued their careers?
this annoys Yazz who can’t stand people saying anything negative about her parents
that’s her prerogative
anyway, she’s resigned herself to hanging out with the squad at uni rather than going out manhunting
it’s unfortunate that she’s coming of age as one of the Swipe-Like-Chat-Invite-Fuck Generation where men expect you to give it up on the first (and only) date, have no pubic hairat all, and do the disgusting things they’ve seen women do in porn movies on the internet
which she suspects the boys in her halls watch all day and all night, boys who are rarely seen outside their rooms (lectures? what lectures?)
she’s only been on one date at uni, which involved sitting at a bar with a male specimen she’d thought was an interesting person, who was obviously swiping his phone to see if someone more fanciable was in the vicinity before making his pathetic excuses about having to do revision
she left shortly after he did, saw him chatting up a woman in a bar a few doors down when she passed on her way home
Yazz reckons that by the time guys her age want to settle down, her ovaries will be busted and they’ll be on to women half their age who can still drop babies at the drop of a hat
so
even though she’s considered reasonably attractive (as in not 100% ugly), with her own unique style (part 90s Goth, part post-hip hop, part slutty ho, part alien), she’s having to compete with images of girls on fucksites with collagen pouts and their bloated silicone tits out
Yazz has considered dating older guys in their thirties (who are always up for banging teenagers), until she visualizes the nose hair, wrinkly cock and pot belly scenario
so until such time as someone suitable comes along (if he ever will) who can offer proper commitment with a view to a monogamous relationship in the long term (her mother she is not), she’s got herself a booty call in Steve, an American who’s studying for a PhD on ‘the interrelationship and aesthetics of hip hop and racial politics in the eighties’
unfortunately, he’s also got a girlfriend in Chicago, which provokes something of a moral conundrum when they’re in bed together, and she calls and he lies about what he’s doing
Yazz sometimes has sleepless nights worrying she’ll be alone for the whole of her life
if she can’t get a proper boyfriend at nineteen what hope is there for when she’s older?
a couple of Mum’s female friends have been single for decades, not the lesbians who have little problem getting off with each other, but the straight ones who’ve got good jobs and houses and no partner to share it with, who say they’re not prepared to settle at this stage in their lives
Mum accuses them of‘Looking for Obama Syndrome’
behind their backs
Nenet, the third member of the squad, is engaged to Kadim who’s studying in America, her parents chose him for her
she resisted at first until they threatened to cast her out, and the thought of having to actually find a job after uni and earn her own money, like the rest of them, brought her round
luckily, she hit it off with him once she actually met and got to know him, and is often off for long weekends (like Wednesday to Monday) in Connecticut where he’s studying
even so she gets As for her coursework, she’s that clever
she’s also super-confident and the last person anyone should mess with
when a boy on campus starting sending her explicit texts, she reported him to the university and he narrowly avoided being thrown out
when a classmate was raped and broke down in front of her, Nenet paid for a lawyer who got the rapist imprisoned for six years
after which, they all agree, he’ll be back on the streets raping more women
Waris is dating Einar, a Somali-Norwegian boy she’s been with since they sat in History together at school
they’re both big anime fans and go to London Comic Con every year
Waris draws cartoons as a hobby and is developing a female Somali superhero
who hunts down men who hurt women
and castrates them, slowly
without anaesthetics
while they lounge around, Yazz makes everyone hot chocolate from sachets and offers the shortbread biscuits Mum makes for her as she’s weirdly taken up baking since Yazz went to uni, almost like she realizes she’s not been the perfect picket-fence mum and is making amends
three-quarters of the squad don’t drink much, if at all
Yazz’s mind is her most valuable asset and she’s not going to mess with it
Waris says yes to the hijab and sex outside marriage, no to booze and pork
Nenet says she expects to start drinking after a few years of marriage to Kadim when he takes on his first official mistress, which is what happened with her own mother, who starts the day with a G&T and ends it with a liqueur, having consumed a bottle of wine or three in between
Courtney’s the only one whose social interactions are accompanied by red wine
Yazz was drawn to Waris on the second day of Fresher Week at the welcome party in the sports hall where they both skulked on the periphery; Yazz gravitated towards Waris’s resting bitch face, as she later told her, which Waris took in good humour, asking Yazz if she’d looked in the mirror recently
they agreed that their peers were really immature, while sipping iced tea in a corner of a Starbucks on campus far away from the bedlam of the other freshers running around with their foam parties, disco paintballing, treasure hunts and group pub crawls that were bound to end up with A&E emergencies, Yazz predicted
whose idea was it? she wrote on the official Fresher Week feedback form
to introduce these poor young things to alcohol poisoning the first week they’re away from home?
why don’t you also book them into rehab now instead of waiting for the first signs of liver damage to show in their second year?
Waris
matches her headscarves with the colour of her flowing clothes
she has green days, brown days, blue days, floral days, fluorescent days– never black days (she’s not a traditionalist)
she often sticks her phone just inside her hijab to carry out hands-free conversations, which Yazz tells her is an excellent blend of religiosity and practicality
to which Waris replies that she wears a hijab to make a statement about her Muslim identity, and while there are those who make out it’s a proper religious thing, there’s nothing about women covering up in theKoran, you know?
Waris doesn’t ever leave her room without applying a smooth paste of foundation on to her already perfect complexion
whole tubes of mascara to thicken already forested eyelashes
and her eyebrows are painted into a high arch that practically stretches all the way to her ears
Waris says she’s ugly without her ‘face on’, even though Yazz reassures her that Somali women are the most beautiful in the world, and that includes you too, Waris
Waris says she’s fat, even though she’s perfectly normal-sized, pinching her thighs so hard they go mottled then showing Yazz her ‘cellulite’, which is non-existent, Waris, it’s just flesh being squeezed so tightly it nearly pops
she sometimes wears sunglasses when there’s no sun – at night and inside buildings
she even tried it on in class, looking fierce and super-cool until one brave lecturer, Dr Sandra Reynolds (call me Sandy, guys and gals), showed she wasn’t the pushover they thought she was when she ordered Waris to take them off unless she had a medical condition and certificate to prove it
or to leave her class
it’s to make myself look fearless, Waris explained to Yazz after they’d treated themselves to a pizza one Saturday lunchtime and were making their way back to campus on the slippery and rainy cobbled streets of the university town where they stood out
or maybe it’s to hide your fear, Yazz suggested, you’re actually feeling fear-ful, the words are separated by a few letters, fear-ful or fear-less, similar but diametrically different, see?
Yazz felt a surge of preternatural wisdom beyond her years
it was one of those moments
Waris looked pensive as they walked on in silence, and then replied, equally sagaciously, perhaps it’s both
in that moment Yazz understood why they got on so well, they were on the same intellectual wavelength
life was different before 9/11, Waris said, as they left the town behind and walked along a busy main road passing big old houses made of thick slabs of grey stone; she was too young to remember the‘before era’, when her mother said people looked at hijabbed women with surprise, curiosity or pity
then there was the‘after era’, when her mother said they began to be viewed with a blatant hostility that gets worse every time a jihadist blows white people up, or mows them down in a truck
at times like these Waris braces herself to get even more shoved, spat at and called names such as dirty Arab when I’m not even Arab, Yazz
Waris said it’s crazy that people are so stupid to think over one and a half billion Muslims all think and act the same way, a Muslim man carries out a mass shooting or blows people up and he’s called a terrorist, a white man does the exact same thing and he’s called a madman
both sets are mad, Yazz
I know, Waris, Iknow
Yazz sees the dirty looks Waris gets when they’re walking through town
she gives dirty looks back on her friend’s behalf
Waris said her grandmother rarely left their council flat in Wolverhampton any more, it was too hard for her to walk the street and get such hostility, and she’s never stopped mourning everything she’s lost
she lived a well-off lifestyle in Mogadishu until 1991, in a family where all the adult men worked in the family dental practice, until they were killed and she fled here with her daughters
these days her grandmother pops prescription pills
she sits in the living room disappearing into herself
until one day she’ll be lost to them for ever
Xaanan, her mother, is completely different, though, she drummed it into us kids that we could either decide to be crushed by the weight of history, and modern-day atrocities, or we could go into warrior pose
Dad works in a factory, Mum has two jobs, the first is working in a refuge for Muslim women and the second is teaching self-defence to women who cover up, so they can learn how to protect themselves from the‘hijab grab’ and related assaults
she teaches a mixture of Krav Maga, Jiu Jitsu, Aikido and Pencak Silat at the local community centre, Waris said proudly; Waris herself learned mixed martial arts alongside her mother
Yazz and Waris arrive back at the campus and walk down the lane, rain abating, skies clearing, rainbow appearing
they pass the gym with students in sporty gear entering and leaving
they pass the laundry, students in a zombie daze watching the machines rotate or playing with their phones
they pass the arts centre with a gallery and a café inside it selling unaffordable coffee and unaffordable cakes for the posh people who come on to campus to use it
they walk past the blocks of the accommodation quarter with music and weed drifting out, until they get to theirs
they go inside the building and climb the stairs as Waris continues talking, says she’s learned to give as good as she gets if anyone saysany of the following
that terrorism is synonymous with Islam
that she’s oppressed and they feel her pain
if anyone asks her if she’s related to Osama bin Laden
if anyone tells her she’s responsible for them being unemployed
if anyone tells her she’s a cockroach immigrant
if anyone tells her to go back to her jihadist boyfriend
if anyone asks her if she knows any suicide bombers
if anyone tells her she doesn’t belong here and when are you leaving?
if anyone asks if she’s going to have an arranged marriage
if anyone asks her why she dresses like a nun
if anyone speaks slowly to her like she can’t speak English
if anyone tells her that her English is really good
if anyone asks her if she’s had FGM, you poor thing
if anyone says they’re going to kill her and her family
you’ve really suffered, Yazz says, I feel sorry for you, not in a patronizing way, it’s empathy, actually
I haven’t suffered, not really, my mother and grandmother suffered because they lost their loved ones and their homeland, whereas my suffering is mainly in my head
it’s not in your head when people deliberately barge into you
it is compared to half a million people who died in the Somali civil war, I was born here and I’m going to succeed in this country, I can’t afford not to work my butt off, I know it’s going to be tough when I go on the job market but you know what, Yazz? I’m not a victim, don’t ever treat me like a victim, my mother didn’t raise me to be a victim.

That afternoon they ended up dancing to Amr Diab in Yazz’s room
Yazz tells Waris it’s important to counterbalance the state of being cerebral with the state of being corporeal
Waris asks her if she means they need to do physical activity because they spend too much time thinking?
yes, that’s it, Yazz says, making elaborate movements with her arms as she dances
why didn’t you just say that then?
they’re still playing his songs very loudly later that evening with Nenet, who lives on the same corridor and first introduced the famous Egyptian singer to them; Yazz had instantly found herself transported as soon as the lyrics poured out of Diab’s sexy lips on the screen
Waris loved him too, said Diab’s music stirred her soul
Yazz said he made her feel love for the man who’ll one day be on the receiving end of her passion
Waris said that man should be afraid, very afraid
Nenet said Diab was old school so for her it was more of a nostalgia thing, as she showed them how to dance Arabic-style with swaying hips and swirling arms, while high on jelly babies
it became their thing– Amr Diab evenings
Courtney, who lived next door, knocked on the door in her pyjamas, and asked them to turn it down because she’s trying to sleep and it’s, like, midnight?
Yazz told her to listenvery carefully to the other people playing loud music in other parts of the building, can she hear them? above and below?
of course she can, it’s a Saturday night, and as soon as the security guards who’ve been called drive off, the noise starts up again
everyone’s at it, right? Yazz said, hands on hips, so why are you targetingus in particular, giving Courtney a look rich with subtext
it was a tense moment, diffused by Nenet, who said she knows how to handle conflict because her father was in the diplomatic service for the entire thirty years of Mubarak’s presidency of Egypt
that’s called a dictatorship, Waris challenged her
it’s called political stability, Nenet swatted back
Nenet’s grandfather had grown up with Mubarak in Kafr El-Meselha, he worked in the Ministry of Justice with him, their families were friends
as a diplomatic couple, her parents acquired the skills to talk to anyone as if they were deeply interested in them, even when they hated the bastards, they’d even be nice to you, Waris, Nenet once said, reassuringly
Waris knew what Nenet meant, Somalis were looked down on in Egypt
when Mubarak’s government fell during the Egyptian revolution, Nenet’s family fled to the UK where they had citizenship anyway because her dad had invested a million pounds here to get it
prior to that, her parents lived in lots of countries while she’d gone to boarding school in Sussex
don’t ask me where my family money comes from, she said, replying to Waris’s enquiry
they’ve never told me
Nenet welcomed Courtney into Yazz’s room, all diplomatic smiles to diffuse the situation, come in, what’s your name? offering her Coca Cola, and when the music began again, showed her moves
just let yourself float, Courtney, imagine you’re water, air, light, let the music move your body, don’t overthink it, the aim is to dance with yourself for yourself
Courtney was soon swirling and floating with the rest of them, she liked this fa-la-la music and why hadn’t she heard of it before?
don’t you think that’s a bit offensive? Yazz asked
why? I like it and belly dancing’s fun, too
it’s not called belly dancing, Yazz replied, that’s so Orientalist and we don’t tolerate that here, at which point Nenet told Yazz to cut it out and explained their dancing is inspired by what’s now called Raqs Sharqi
okay, Courtney said, shrugging, doing a fancy spin and dancing as if she could divorce her hips from her waist, her waist from her chest, her arms from her torso and her hands from her arms
she was moving better than all of them
they all crashed on Yazz’s floor that night, had breakfast together in the refectory
Courtney told them she grew up on a wheat and barley farm in Suffolk, they joked it explained her farm girl looks
sparkling eyes, Nenet said
translucent skin, Yazz said
milkmaid breasts, Waris added
Waris, who’d never left Wolverhampton before travelling for university open days, admitted she’d never stepped on a farm in her life
me neither, Yazz said, my soul is urbanista not ruralite
Nenet informed them that her parents have a farm in the Cotswolds which breeds llamas and a wine estate in the Franschhoek Valley in South Africa
Waris said it was all right for some, to which Nenet replied it’s not my fault, Waris said fair-dos
Yazz said that while she liked the idea of fresh milk, the idea of cocks crowing when you want to sleep in put her off, similarly she liked the idea of fresh milk but not milking cows to get it, or killing them for your beef burgers
Waris said she liked the idea of going on daily bracing walks across the meadows, whereupon Courtney told her she hates walking and there are no meadows anywhere near her farm
as she ate her breakfast of eggs, bacon and baked beans, Courtney made the mistake of asking Waris why she wore a headscarf
Yazz looked up from her muesli expecting to see Waris kick off, instead, she dug her spoon in her thick porridge and said in a surprisingly mild voice that it’s Number One – cultural, Number Two – political, and then, just as Yazz expected her to say Number Three – none of your damned business, she didn’t
Waris simply said her mother told her she didn’t need to explain herself to anyone
Nenet, on to her second espresso and nibbling on a boiled egg, was ready to step in– not necessary, Courtney apologized, although she sounded more petulant than sorry, I was only asking because I didn’t know
cool, well now you do
Yazz decided that although Courtney was quite ignorant of other cultures, she’d shown strength of character and chutzpah, a precondition for joining the Unfuckwithables where they all tended to speak their minds and you had to fight back and not run off crying to the toilet like a wimp
she liked Courtney
and if she liked her
she was in the squad
one Monday morning a few months later, Yazz informed her, as they queued for the toilet after the Race, Class and Gender class, that she was in effect now an honorary sistah with anh, a term that originated with black women which was now being appropriated (typical!) by those who weren’t
however, Courtney could never be a fully-fledged sistah, only honorarily so
she explained that being a sistah was a response to how we’re seen as much as who we are, which actually defies simplistic reductionism, and that who we are is partly a response to how we’re seen, babe
Yazz found herself calling people she liked‘babe’ these days, it wasn’t forced or pretentious, it just happened naturally
it’s a conundrum, Yazz continued the conversation over lunch of bean soup for her (protein for the brain) and meat, mash and mushy peas for Courtney
people won’t see you as just another woman any more, but as a white woman who hangs with brownies, and you’ll lose a bit of your privilege, you should still check it, though, have you heard the expression, check your privilege, babe?
Courtney replied that seeing as Yazz is the daughter of a professor and a very well-known theatre director, she’s hardly underprivileged herself, whereas she, Courtney, comes from a really poor community where it’s normal to be working in a factory at sixteen and have your first child as a single mother at seventeen, and that her father’s farm is effectively owned by the bank
yes but I’m black, Courts, which makes me more oppressed than anyone who isn’t, except Waris who is the most oppressed of all of them (although don’t tell her that)
in five categories: black, Muslim, female, poor, hijabbed
she’s the only one Yazz can’t tell to check her privilege
Courtney replied that Roxane Gay warned against the idea of playing‘privilege Olympics’ and wrote inBad Feminist that privilege is relative and contextual, and I agree, Yazz, I mean, where does it all end? is Obama less privileged than a white hillbilly growing up in a trailer park with a junkie single mother and a jailbird father? is a severely disabled person more privileged than a Syrian asylum-seeker who’s been tortured? Roxane argues that we have to find a new discourse for discussing inequality
Yazz doesn’t know what to say, when did Court read Roxane Gay – who’s amaaaazing?
was this a student outwitting the master moment?
#whitegirltrumpsblackgirl
Courtney added that as she only fancies black men and is likely going to have mixed-race children, her‘white privilege’ is in any case going to be seriously dented, like at least 50% of it, and it’s incredible in this day and age that she’d never met any black people in the flesh before she came to university from Dartingford which is entirely white except for three Asians
Yazz informed her that’s a non sequitur, conversation-wise
Courtney replied that she herself is a big fan of the non sequitur which really only means that a conversation is free-flowing and intuitive, as opposed to following a predictable trajectory, so to speak
Yazz excused herself to go to the toilet.

Yazz invited Courtney to stay at hers at the end of their first year
she warned her that at least one of Mum’s harem was likely to be walking about the house half-naked in the morning and trust me, that’s not a pleasant sight with the oldies
Courtney’d only been to London once before, a day trip involving a bus tour to Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square, Big Ben, St Paul’s Cathedral and the Tower of London, before getting the train straight back to Dartingford
they shared Yazz’s double bed and chatted before they went to sleep that first night with the lights off and the moon shining straight on to the bed, which made the night feel special to Yazz, especially when the nights were warm and the window was open
as they lay there, Yazz asked Courtney why she hadn’t visited the capital more often, you don’t know what you’ve been missing, babe
it’s because my parents don’t like London, Courtney replied, they think it’s a hellhole full of coloureds, suicide bombers, left-wingers, luvvies, gays and Polish immigrants, who deprive the hardworking men and women of this country of the chance to earn a good living; Dad gets all his political thoughts from the newspapers, quotes from them verbatim, although funnily enough he’s friends with Raj, the mechanic in the village, they drink together down the pub
when I call him a hypocrite, he says, it’sRaj, Courtney, he’sdifferent
you can tell your dad from me that the British economy would collapse without immigrants to set higher working standards, Mum says give me a Polish plumber or electrician over homegrown workers any day
it makes no difference to him, he says they’re all the same, love, meaning all the people he hates
I can’t wait to see his face when I bring home a mixed-race baby
Yazz showed Courtney Peckham, Stockwell, Brixton, Streatham
as they walked down Brixton High Street, Courtney said she was going to faint at all the beefsteak on show, couldn’t help staring at the juicy buns on the boys whose jeans were so low they exposed almost their entire underpants
Yazz noticed that those‘buns’ reciprocated Courtney’s attention, her creamy softness pouring ostentatiously over the top of her denim blouse
they stared at Courtney, not at Yazz, who wasn’t the one getting checked out as usual, and she usually got checked out alot
not that she’s interested in the kind of male who belts their trousers underneath their bum
today it’s all about Courtney, who’s not even particularly hot and it’s like Yazz is invisible and her friend is an irresistible goddess
a white girl walking with a black girl is always seen as black-man-friendly
Yazz has been here before with other white mates
it makes her feel so
jaded
they arranged to meet up with Nenet at her family house behind Queensway
Nenet texted the directions,‘around the corner from Hyde Park LOL’
they arrived at a large house behind a security gate and had to ring the bell to be let into a drive made of crunchy gravel
a maid wearing a black uniform with white pinafore let them into a hallway of marble floors, fountain, colonnades and a winding Hollywood staircase that went all the way up to a domed roof
Nenet came bounding down the stairs to greet them holding a tiny ball of fluffy white fur in her arms, her shih-tzu, Lady Maisie
here, she said, thrusting it at them, have a cuddle
Courtney was happy to oblige, even let it snuggle up to her face, cooing about how cute it was, being used to far worse with farm animals, Yazz imagined, like pigs and sticking her hands up cows’ anuses to release their constipated stools
she herself declined to touch it, not liking to get too close to things that licked their own bottoms clean
Nenet gave them a quick tour of the house, which Yazz thought was sick, as in obscenely richsick not sick as in wonderful
Nenet apologized for her mother’s ostentatious taste in home decor, not for her wealth
please be careful what you touch, squaddies!
Yazz noticed Courtney acting as if she was honoured to have been allowed into Nenet’s life now that she’d seen how she lived
Nenet was now‘Nenet who lives in a huge house near Hyde Park’, something Yazz couldn’t mentally undo or un-factor into her opinion of her friend
she realized that knowing someone comes from money isn’t the same as witnessing the extent of it in close proximity

they went for a walk in Hyde Park, strolled along the Serpentine in the sunshine
Yazz looked out at the blue lake and people enjoying themselves in pedalos and rowing boats
the path around it seemed to be a cruising strip for rich Arabs, the car park rammed with cars with doors that opened upwards and golden wheel hubs that could save the National Health Service
Nenet, who usually wore designer sportswear at uni, was clad in a tight top, short skirt, high heels, and looped over her shoulder was a Chanel bag with a gold chain
her body language changed whenever a group of young men approached to admiringly check her over, which they did without fail, what with her cascading black hair, gleaming brown skin and toned legs
this was her milieu, she was walking like a princess, a bit up herself
Nenet always insisted she was Mediterranean, much to Yazz’s amusement and Waris’s annoyance when she tried to convince them she wasn’t black or even African as her family were from Alexandria on the Egyptian coast
you’re African, Nenet, Waris lambasted her, go on, admit it, you’re an African woman, and she’d jump on Nenet and pretend to beat her up, the pair of them squealing like six-year-olds
the Serpentine cruisers ignored Yazz who was way too dark for them (yeh and they can piss off)
they boldly slow-stripped Courtney with their eyes as if she was a chambermaid
Courtney got off on it, loving the attention
Yazz didn’t want to break the news to her
the three of them discussed university in a way they didn’t when they were on campus, but somehow today felt different, their first year had passed, the long summer stretched ahead
Yazz and Courtney were going to spend it prepping for their second year by getting on top of their reading lists, that and summer jobs would keep them busy
Waris had already started an internship at a Wolverhampton charity for ex-offenders
Courtney was about to start work in a lifestyle farm shop in Suffolk that sold cookers for ten thousand pounds
Yazz was waitressing in a hip West End restaurant frequented by oligarchs, celebrities and Premier League footballers with their trophy wives, mistresses and escorts
she made notes on her phone for her future memoir
and took surreptitious photos with her iPhone
Nenet, who was getting off on being in her natural habitat and the centre of attention, confided that she wasn’t planning on doing any reading for her Art History course because – guess what?
she blurted out that she didn’t need to
and this is confidential so pleeeeaaase don’t tell a soul, especially not Waris, the truth is that I commission my essays from a retired academic
she turned to face them, expecting admiration, approval
Yazz was stunned, replied quietly, you’re supposed to work for your degree like everyone else, I didn’t know you were one of the cheats
it’s not cheating when everyone else is doing it
that doesn’t make it right and not everyone is at it
wake up, Yazz, people aren’t going to tell you, are they? Kadim’s MBA is costing him a fortune
Yazz wondered if their friendship could overcome Nenet’s cheating on top of her extreme privilege, it explained why she could binge-watch an entire Netflix series the night before an exam and still get an A+ for her coursework
Nenet was a spoilt, lazy and immoral princess who didn’t play by the rules and would do anything to hold on to her privilege, even marry someone picked by her parents
Yazz wondered if sharing the same corridor in halls and being one of the few brown girls on a white campus was really enough to keep the Unfuckwithables together post-university, or even into their second year, come to think of it
Yazz had to work hard, to lay the groundwork for the future because she’s got to be at the top of her game, and Courtney (or rather Roxane Gay) really was right, she can see that now, privilege is about context and circumstance
and even if she was rich she wouldn’t cheat, she’s going to earn her first class degree and like Waris will bust a gut to get it, she’s not going to be ejected into the big bad world with a poor degree and no master plan, last term she met third year students about to graduate who looked terrified when she asked them about their next steps
a Master’s in Journalism beckons, in London, where she fits in and can live rent free with Mum
she’s already a regular feature writer for the student newspaper,Nu Vox, and her column,Why is My Professor Not Black?, inspired by a student conference she attended in her first term, generated more online comments than any other that month, only half of them totally ignorant, of course, written anonymously by the inbred, pea-brained, racist, cowardly, fugly and utterly friendlesstrolls of this planet
the point is, the article boosted her rep and she’s become a personality on campus, someone asked for her opinion by the Media Society and student radio
she’s going to try and place articles in professional newspapers and über-blogs next year, and she’s going to assume the editorship ofNu Vox in her third year, when she’s eligible
she’s going to get herself elected President of the Media Society
she’s already thinking about her campaign strategy
woe betide any pipsqueak usurpers who get in her way
she knows it won’t be easy, she’s ready for the fight
Yazz reflects on the rest of the squad
Courtney’s a really nice person, formerly naïve and uncomplicated, who’s grown so much since she first arrived at uni and is now more worldly-wise through her membership of the squad, who aren’t your typical students in the east of England, that is:
a badass humanitarian whose mother is a lesbian luvvie and whose father is a gay‘intellectual’
a super-rich (cheat) who’s politically connected to the old Egyptian elite
a Muslim Somali woman who wears a hijab and is a mixed martial artist
Waris is the deepest of them all, because her family has such a painful history, even though she hates it when people feel sorry for her
Waris’s life has been the most unfair and it’s forced her to prematurelymaturate
just as life’s obstacles have forced her, Yazz, to prematurelymaturate, too
and so it begins
The Last Amazon of Dahomey
the play.
Dominique
1
Dominique came across Nzinga at Victoria station in the rush hour
as she was being knocked down by the steamrollering effect of London’s ruthless commuters determined to catch their trains at all costs
her bag fell open and everything fell out: passport,A–Z,Rough Guide to London, hemp purse, tampons, Zenith E camera, Palmer’s hand cream, evil eye charm, ivory-handled hunting knife
Nzinga was profusely grateful when a passing Dominique approached to help, the pair of them scrambling about on the station floor gathering up her belongings
when that was done, and Nzinga was once more upright and composed, Dominique found herself in front of an extraordinary vision
the woman was statuesque, her skin glowed, her robes flowed, her features were sculptural, lips fulsome, thin ropes of dreadlocks fell freely down to her hips, silver amulets and bright beads sewn into them
Dominique had never seen anyone like her before, offered to buy her coffee, confident she’d say yes because lesbians, and she suspected this one was, usually did
they sat opposite each other in the station café as Nzinga sipped on a glass of hot water with a slice of lemon in it, the only hot drink she allowed to pass her lips, she said, I don’t abuse my body
meanwhile
Dominique, drinking a cup of granulated coffee into which she’d dissolved two sugars and was dunking a succession of digestive biscuits (a packet of Maltesers at the side for dessert), felt guilty about the rubbish she was unthinkingly putting into her body – abusing it, yes, abusing it
she’d never met an African-American before and Nzinga’s accent evoked the sensory delights of warm cornbread, sticky ribs, gumbo, jambalaya, collard greens, cracklin’, fried cabbage, peanut brittle – and other foods she’s read about in novels by African-American women
Nzinga was visiting England for the first time since leaving as a small child, on her way back from a pilgrimage to Ghana where she’d spent two weeks, it was her first time in the Motherland, visiting Elmina Castle where captured Africans had been incarcerated before being shipped to the Americas as slaves
the guide led them into a dungeon, shut the door
in the hot, suffocating darkness he graphically described how up to a thousand people were crammed into a space meant for two hundred, with no facilities or sanitation and little food or water, for up to three months
in that moment all the painful history of four hundred years of slavery entered my body in a way it hadn’t before and I broke down and sobbed, Dominique, I sobbed and realized more than ever that the white man has a lot to answer for
Dominique stopped herself replying that the African man had also sold Africans into slavery so it was a lot more complex than that
Nzinga was a builder of timber houses on‘wimmin’s lands’ in the ‘Dis-United States of America’ where she’d lived since she was five and her mother, tiring of Nzinga’s father who flitted between various women in England and the Caribbean, fell for a handsome ex-Forces man via correspondence
she was only twenty-two when she stupidly moved Nzinga and her brother, Andy, from their flat in Luton into what turned out to be a mobile home in a trailer park in Texas
where she and her brother slept on the floor by the kitchenette, while her mother and the man shared the pull-down double bed and had loud sex a few feet away from them
he drank hooch from the minute he woke up to just before he fell into a drunken and drugged stupor at night, picking up odd jobs here and there
her mother found work in a chicken factory, was idiotically convinced she could cure him of his addictions and make a life for her children with him
her futile attempts to curtail his addictions resulted in being beaten up so often she gave up trying to change him and fell into the drug life herself
what began badly became worse as Nzinga found herself being badly raised by two junkies whose priority was not her and her brother
eventually the inevitable happened when she reached puberty, there’d been earlier signs, inappropriate touching and comments she’d been too young to decipher and later, too vulnerable to ward off
she had her virginity stolen while her mother and brother were out shopping and she’d stayed in to do her homework
the next morning she managed to tell a teacher at school after she’d burst into tears, a man, as it happens, who’d always told her she was clever child – practically the only good man she’s ever known
a social worker was assigned, she and her brother were fostered out to a family
who cared for them but did not love them
not deeply, not unconditionally
Andy went into the army at sixteen and turned his back on the sister who’d turned into a bull-dyke, as he called her when he discovered her in bed with her girlfriend
luckily, I really was bright and worked hard to get into the recently desegregated University of Texas at Austin, instead of the local community college
upon graduation, I set off to live in a women’s commune to get away from people like my brother and thebeast
when my mother died from an overdose
my brother and I didn’t talk at the funeral
or since
Dominique sat there listening to the extraordinary vision before her, a woman who’d risen above the tragedy of her terrible childhood to become so magnificent, who exuded such warmth and experience
people saw Dominique as tough and self-sufficient, yet compared to Nzinga, she wasn’t, Nzinga was powerful, unconquerable, her presence and energy dominated the café, her voice suffused a grey Monday afternoon with an exotic sensuous drawl
she was a zami, a sexy sistah, an inspiration, a phenomenon
Dominique wanted to curl into this woman and be looked after by her
it was a new feeling because she’d been fully independent since leaving home, and here she was, feeling, what? excited? definitely
perhaps falling in love with a complete stranger
I think you might be right, Dominique replied later that day as they sat in Cranks wholefood restaurant in Leicester Square after Nzinga had suggested her relationship history of blonde girlfriends might be a sign of self-loathing; you have to ask yourself if you’ve been brainwashed by the white beauty ideal, sister, you have to work a lot harder on your black feminist politics, you know
Dominique wondered if she had a point, why did she go for stereotypical blondes? Amma had teased her about it without judging her, she herself was a product of various mixtures and often had partners of all colours
in contrast, Nzinga had grown up in the segregated South, although shouldn’t that make her pro-integration rather than against it?
Dominique wondered if she really was still being brainwashed by white society, and whether she really was failing at the identity she most cherished– the black feminist one
she decided that Nzinga was a fairy angel sent to help her become a better version of herself
she became Nzinga’s personal guide around the city, keen to show off how well she knew its history and hotspots, hopping on and off buses, taking shortcuts through the labyrinthine tunnels of the underground, slipping down ancient alleyways in the city’s oldest parts, showing her the remnants of the Roman wall from nearly two thousand years ago, taking her on to the pebbly Thames beaches when the tide was out, where mud-larkers trawled for buried archaeological relics, through the numerous parks, greens, public gardens and wilder commons, on canal walks that lasted hours from Little Venice to the marshes of Walthamstow, on river cruises to Greenwich and Kew
at night, they slipped into tucked-away women’s clubs
where they made out in darkened corners
they slept together the day they met and every night thereafter
it’s so sublime, it’s spiritual, Dominique raved at Amma when she turned up for work a fortnight later to a desk-full of incomplete tasks
I’ve fallen in love properly for the first time in my life with the most wonderful woman I’ve ever met, who desires me from a position of inner strength, Amma, and it might sound odd but that’s so new to me and darned sexy, like she can rip my clothes off whenever she wants to (which she does)and I feel helpless and dominated (which I like), whereas my previous lovers desired me from a position of weakness, of adoration, which just isn’t interesting to me any more
the tension between us is electrostatic, Ams, it’s like I’m being charged up with electric volts, we can’t bear to be apart, not even for five minutes, Nzinga is so wise and knowledgeable about how to be a liberated black woman in an oppressive white world that she’s opening my eyes to, well, everything, it’s like she’s Alice and Audre and Angela and Aretha rolled into one, seriously, Ams
Amma replied that this Nzinga must be something else to turn the coolest dyke of us all into a lovestruck teenager, so when do I get to meet Alice-Audre-Angela-Aretha? what’s her real name, by the way?
Cindy, if you must know, don’tever tell her I told you
Dominique agreed to bring her to lunch at the King’s Cross squat, on Nzinga’s strict proviso that only women of colour were invited, and the food had to be completely vegan, organic and fresh
or she couldn’t be in the same room as it.

Nzinga really did look spectacular when she walked in the door of Amma’s room in Freedomia
she was at least six foot tall with ornamented dreadlocks, large wooden Akuaba fertility doll earrings, red trousers, a cream embroidered caftan and strappy Roman sandals
she was somewhat older than them, yet somehow appeared ageless
Amma noted how the force of her presence had the effect of diminishing everyone else’s
before she arrived, her guests wanted to like Nzinga because they liked Dominique, now she was here, they wanted to impress her
Amma wanted Nzinga to prove herself worthy of Dominique’s love
Nzinga sat cross-legged in the circle of women on the floor where the meal was to take place (Amma found the idea of a dining table too suburban)
vegetable casserole with sweet potato, salads and brown loaves were spread out before them on a plastic tablecloth
(everything was from the budget supermarket, nothing was organic or fresh, who could tell once vegetables were cooked or chopped, and how dare Nzinga demand everyone eat according to her preferences)
the conversation was lively, everybody wanted to talk to Nzinga who’d been afforded a gravitas she hadn’t earned, Amma thought, simply by looking like a swamp-diva-voodoo-queen
Nzinga lapped up the attention, was friendly, nomagnanimous, with everyone, until she ruined it by exclaiming, somewhat scornfully, how weird it was to hear so many black women sounding soBritissshhh
Amma thought she was accusing them of being too white or at best, in-authentically black, she’d come across it before, foreigners equating an English accent with whiteness, she always felt the need to speak up when it was implied that black Brits were inferior to African-Americans or Africans or West Indians
in any case, it might explain why Dominique had adopted an American lilt in the short period of time she’d been with Nzinga (oh Dominique!)
that’s because we are, Amma replied, British,all of us are, right? yet she was instinctively aware that to challenge Nzinga wasn’t wise
Nzinga didn’t miss a beat in replying that black women need to identify racism wherever we find it, especially our own internalized racism, when we’re filled with such a deep self-loathing we turn against our own
it struck Amma that this woman could be a formidable opponent, the energy that had hitherto radiated warmth had quickly turned radioactive
Dominique, usually an opinionated loudmouth, was oblivious to the bilateral tensions in the room– two alpha females about to go nuclear
she sat purring at her beloved’s side
we have to be vigilant, Nzinga said to the gathered women who seemed hypnotized by her, we must be careful who we allow into our lives, she said, now staring at Amma with open hostility, there are women among us who’ve been sent to destroy us, internalized racism is everywhere, my friends (her friends?)
we have to be vigilant about everything, and everyone
point made, she then proceeded to ignore Amma
we have to be vigilant with our language, too, she continued, have you noticed that the word black, for example, always has negative connotations?
heads nodded, to Amma’s dismay, what was the matter with them?
Nzinga then launched into the racial implications of stepping on a black doormat rather than over it, of not wearing black socks (why would you step on your own people?), and don’t ever use black garbage bags, she instructed, as for blackmail, blackball, black mood, black magic, black sheep, black-hearted, I never wear black underpants, for example, why crap on myself? I’m surprised you all don’t know this already
there were more nods, Amma kept flashing Dominique looks, is she serious? areyou serious? except Dominique was too preoccupied lapping up this codswallop
Amma had had enough, she alone would have to deal with this woman, seeing as everyone else’s brains had turned to mush
that’s not a problem for me, she said, because guess what, I’ve not crapped my pants since I stopped wearing nappies as a kid
there was a detectable ripple of suppressed laughter in the room, great! she was breaking Nzinga’s spell, who was livid, this is no time for cheap jokes, Amma, I think you need to listen to Bob Marley’s ‘Redemption Song’ and emancipate yourself from mental slavery
Amma considered thanking Nzinga for informing her she was mentally enslaved, and told her that African peoples were referred to as black long after the word made its appearance in the English language, so it makes no sense to retroactively impose racist connotations on to its everyday usage, and if you do, you’re going to drive yourself mad and, I’m sorry to say, everyone else with you
I’m surprised you don’t know this already
it took Nzinga under a minute to make her excuses, Dominique in tow
Amma was pleased to see the back of the awfulCindy
the old Dominique would have done the same in her position
the new Dominique had become gullible to every piece of shit the voodoo queen spouted
how on earth had this happened?
Amma hoped the Nzinga phase would end when the woman returned to America
shewas returning to America, wasn’t she?
at the end of their summer of love, Dominique (cowardly) told Amma on the phone she’d been issued with an ultimatum by Nzinga, either she goes to the US with her, or we go our separate ways, I don’t do long distance, daaarlin’
Amma told her she was crazy, don’t go with that woman, Dominique, don’t go
but having found real love, Dominique followed it to America.

Nzinga was a teetotal, vegan, non-smoking, radical feminist separatist lesbian housebuilder, living and working on wimmin’s land all over America before moving on, a gypsy housebuilder
Dominique was a drinking, drug-dabbling, chain-smoking lesbian feminist carnivorous clubber who produced theatre by women and lived in a London flat
she soon became a teetotal, vegan, non-smoking, radical feminist lesbian housebuilder on wimmin’s land called Spirit Moon, which only allowed lesbians to reside there
other females could visit, adult males and boys over ten could not
their job was to help build affordable houses in order to tempt younger women to revitalize an ageing community
the rural setting of Spirit Moon with its endless space and vistas was invigorating to Dominique compared to the polluted air, dirty streets, frenzied atmosphere and hard-edges of London where life happened at such a fast pace she’d been swept up into its masculine (as Nzinga pointed out) metropolitan maelstrom ever since first arriving from Bristol
the two of them were allocated a log cabin at the furthest reaches of the estate, an idyllically isolated corner where they could snuggle away from the world and toast crumpets over an open hearth
in front of them were fields, behind was a beech, birch and maple forest
that first night Dominique was too excited to sleep, she went to sit on the veranda in the darkness listening to the unfamiliar sounds of the countryside
how could Amma have wanted to deny her this experience? was it jealousy, as Nzinga suspected, saying that as she’d usurped Amma as the most important person in Dominique’s life, Amma couldn’t handle it?
it was true that she and Amma had been soulmates without the sex and now Nzinga was her soulmate, a total, one-off goddess, why couldn’t Amma see that? and her rudeness at the dinner was unforgivable, how could she have twisted Nzinga’s words when she was only trying to help everyone understand how racism worked?
Nzinga was a good person with a big heart
who’d landed in Dominique’s life when she was in between lovers and ready for something different
and just as she was tiring of running a theatre company where she spent too much time on the conveyor belt of writing grant applications with a measly 10% return
Amma hadn’t really taken on board her complaints about this, had always reminded her what a great team they were, Dom, look at what we’ve achieved
yes, but deep down Dominique had wanted something new, an adventure, even though she hadn’t articulated it and didn’t know what form it would take
long summers on Lesbos where she camped on the beach with hundreds of other lesbians were no longer quite so enchanting after seven consecutive years
European city breaks were okay but hardly fulfilling, she’d been to Guyana a couple of times and knew she couldn’t really live there easily as an out lesbian, and she wasn’t interested in teaching English as a second language somewhere abroad, a popular option with other twenty-somethings
and then Planet Venus beamed Nzinga down to her at Victoria station to give her the Great Love that Changes Everything
that first week at Spirit Moon they were invited to a buffet at the house of Gaia, who owned the estate and bequeathed it to the trustees in her will, to ensure it remained wimmin’s land in perpetuity
her home was a sprawling ranch house with vaulted ceilings, patchwork throws, curvilinear sculptures of female bodies, pottery vases, bucolic paintings and tapestry wall hangings Gaia had made herself
there were no images of any men
anywhere
they poured outside to enjoy the warm night, the lawn lit by flaming torches staked into the ground
the clear soprano of Joan Baez, mournful alto of Joni Mitchell, and the richer, melodious contraltos of Joan Armatrading and Tracy Chapman emanated from the deck of the record player on the veranda
Dominique heard crickets, the distant sounds of owls, the hum of women enjoying each other’s company, she was fascinated and felt like a time-traveller who’d voyaged into a quite magical alternate society
the women’s faces were tanned, healthy, seemingly untroubled, as if they were at ease with themselves and each other
all this happy-happiness felt weird to Dominique as she moved among this group of strangers who greeted her with genuine enthusiasm
was this a cult?
she was used to cool Londoners who checked you out with a critical eye before deciding if you were worthy of their time and conversation
Gaia’s grey hair was whipped up into a bun, others wore plaits or crew cuts, a couple of the black women favoured the simplicity of cornrows
they wore jeans and slacks, tee-shirts and baggy shirts, gilets or waistcoats, jumpsuits and baggy dresses, nobody wore make-up or high heels
they brewed their own beer, had a vineyard, a few smoked cigarettes and marijuana, Dominique longed for a relaxing draw, but she’d promised Nzinga she was done with it, agreeing that a poisoned body was a sign of a poisoned mind
the women who lived in the community came from every profession, as well as former housewives, they were craftswomen, chefs, teachers, farmers, shopkeepers, musicians, many were retired
Dominique was curious to know more
Gaia told her she’d been through the wars for social and legislative acceptance in the fifties and sixties, eventually deciding to turn her back on men, she was done with the patriarchy
when she inherited her parents’ Long Island mansion, she bought this farm
did she miss men?
never, the women of Spirit Moon try to live in harmony, even when arguments break out, we have a talking circle and try to sort it out, women can also choose to live hundreds of acres apart until things cool down, a feud might take years to heal, in time there’s forgiveness, even if scars remain
occasionally a resident is forced to leave over unsanctionable behaviour such as violence or theft, if a woman goes straight and wants relationships with men, she has to leave, if she’s celibate, she can stay, once we had a woman who turned and was caught sneaking men on to the property at night
she had to go
Dominique said the women seemed very laid back, not the ball-breakers of her imagination, although there was nothing wrong with ball-breakers, she’d even been accused of it herself
there’s no need to be breaking balls here, Dominique (what a pretty name you have), because there are no men here, which is why we come across as serene to you, we can just be ourselves, reclaiming the Feminine Divine, connecting to and protecting Mother Earth, sharing our resources, making decisions communally but maintaining our privacy and autonomy, self-healing the female body and psyche with yoga, martial arts, walking, running, meditation, spiritual practice
whatever works for each one of us
Dominique chatted freely, moving at ease between the women, as fascinated with them as they were with her, a black British woman, a rarity in these parts, they commented, visibly appraising her favourably
she was used to that, and enjoyed it
Nzinga stayed in her seat on the veranda all night, grim-faced, people approached her warily as a result, whenever Dominique looked over, she noticed Nzinga monitoring her every movement, although it didn’t stop her mingling, enjoying a conversation with a stunning Native American woman called Esther, who wore a figure-hugging jumpsuit, who taught Ashtanga yoga to women in town, who hoped Dominique would come to her sixty-fifth birthday party
I’d love to, Dominique replied, complimenting Esther on looking so great for her age, just as Nzinga unexpectedly tapped her on the shoulder
we have to go
really?
they walked back to their house in the dark on paths that cut through the fields either side of them, Nzinga beamed the torch ahead, Dominique felt happily removed from her customary life in London in this quite special place, was she going to go all hippy-dippy, too?
Nzinga was quiet for a while, then declared it’s better if we don’t socialize any more, once is enough, I’m here to be with you, not them, and I can only take so much of the fake friendship of white women and their flunkies, if they invite you to their talking circle say no, it’s a ruse to find out your private business and use it against you at a later date
remember we’re here to work, it’ll only mess things up if we blur the boundaries, and trust me, don’t believe all that Mother Earth bullshit, I’ve been around enough of these women’s communities to know these witches are as malevolent as any other person out there
why are we here if you’re so critical of them? Dominique asked
because I don’t want to live in a man’s world
they continued talking and walking, feet crunching on stony ground
with me, you’re safe, Nzinga said, although Dominique wasn’t feeling particularly unsafe
with me, you’re complete, although Dominique wasn’t feeling incomplete
with me, you’re home, because home is a person and not a place
Nzinga said she’d been thinking about renaming Dominique as Sojourner, a feminist re-baptism, after Sojourner Truth, the anti-slavery activist, proceeding to deliver a potted history, although Dominique knew exactly who the legendary abolitionist was, as every self-respecting black feminist did, and said so
she still got the lecture
it will be a feminist awakening of your new self, Nzinga explained, having a name more appropriate than a feminized Dominic
I like my name
so keep it, I’ll call you Sojourner anyway, daaarlin’
Dominique decided Nzinga could call her what she liked, she wasn’t going to answer to bloody Sojourner or any other name, Nzinga was showing signs of being a bit odd, perhaps Amma was right when she’d warned her, don’t go to America with that woman, Dom, you’ll regret it
the veranda light of their log cabin emerged out of the darkness, Nzinga said the dark wasn’t something to be feared when staying on land occupied only by women
Dominique thought rapists and serial killers didn’t need to be brain surgeons to surmount a high fence to get to their prey
they lit candles in the bedroom, made love, Nzinga said it was how they shared their deepest connection, Dominique agreed to that, sex with Nzinga was a wholly enjoyable experience in that Nzinga mainly serviced her, which she discovered she liked, as opposed to the more egalitarian actualities of her sexual past, which now seemed unfulfilling, although not at the time
as they lay awake afterwards in each other’s arms, Dominique did feel complete, or at least more complete
Nzinga stared up at the low beams of the timber ceiling and told Dominique she’d earned the right to hear more about her life, starting with Roz, her first partner, now it was clear they were going to spend the rest of their lives together
Dominique thought that was premature
a lifetime was a vast distance into the unknowable future
when you’re still only in your twenties
it’s early days yet, Nzinga
she wanted to say
it was on wimmin’s land in Oregon where Nzinga met Roz who she thought was the love of her life, an older white woman who showed her that women were much happier without men
Roz was a builder of everything from garden sheds to tree houses to cabins to large houses and barns, Nzinga was apprenticed to her
for the first few years she felt cherished, blessed
it was a pretty idyllic existence working together during the day, loving together at night, until she discovered Roz was a lapsed alcoholic who kept it secret, it came out when Nzinga found Roz’s secret stash of gin which she was working her way through while Nzinga slept
after the first confrontation, nothing Nzinga could do was right
they fought, first verbally, then physically, ornaments were smashed, furniture upturned, curtains ripped off, window panes cracked, one night Roz was rushed to hospital, a broken bone, minor head contusions, nothing major, nothing life-threatening
the (all white, of course) women’s community blamed Nzinga, said they’d had enough and it was time for her to go, which was deeply unfair
she was callously evicted, packed her belongings into a single rucksack, was escorted to the gates and ejected into the outside world
it took her years to get over the injustice of it
Nzinga hit the road, hired herself out to women’s communities on the Eastern seaboard, recovered emotionally, had a couple of relationships that ended badly when people revealed their true selves, decided to go searching for a true soul sister, which took years
I had to travel all the way to London to find her
you– Sojourner
Nzinga turned to face Dominique, pillow to pillow, cupped her cheeks in her large, strong hands
now that I’ve opened up to you, let’s agree not to keep any secrets between us from now on, I want to know everything about you and you will know everything about me
agree?
Dominique nodded, aware, however, that turning her head from side to side was practically impossible because it was held in the iron clamp of Nzinga’s hands, no longer just warm and romantic but mechanical
do you still love me?
more than ever, Dominique replied honestly, even more admiring of Nzinga for her honesty and strength in surmounting such trials
she was grateful that such a woman had chosen her
or rather
as Nzinga said, love chose them.

4
A few months in and the love that chose them was too often tumultuous
they were arguing more than Dominique ever had in her life, to the point where she wondered about the truth of Nzinga’s break-up with Roz
Nzinga never saw herself as less than faultless
the problem with you, Sojourner, is that you’re used to leading instead of being led, she’d say, remember you’re my apprentice – in housebuilding, in living a truly radical separatist feminist lesbian life, in steering clear of the enemy, in living free of chemical toxins, in living off the soil and on the soil, it really won’t work if you insist on fighting me at every turn
so when did our love affair turn into an apprenticeship? I’m a leader myself, aren’t I?
ah, but is that really you? Nzinga challenged, often in the middle of the night when Dominique was desperate to sleep and they’d been arguing for hours and just when she nodded off, Nzinga would shake her awake and start making the same points again
what if you drop the tough girl act and justbe?
what if you discover who you truly are deep down?
what if you allow yourself the luxury of being cared for– completely?
Dominique’s feelings were conflicted, Nzinga was still glorious, still magnificent, still the object of her passion, still someone she believed wanted the best for her, who’d rescued her from London
as she was often reminded
when things were good, Dominique felt the headiness of a love that really might last for ever
when they weren’t, she wondered what she was doing with someone who wanted to micro-manage her entire life, including her mind
why did Nzinga think being in love with her meant she had to give up her independence and submit completely?
wasn’t that being like a male chauvinist?
Dominique felt like an altered version of herself after a while, her mind foggy, emotions primal, senses heightened
she enjoyed the sex and affection– outside in the fields when summer arrived, wantonly naked in the heat, unworried about anyone coming across them, what Nzinga called Dominique’s sexual healing, as if she’d been suffering terribly when she met her
Dominique let it pass
she wanted to talk this through with friends, Amma most of all, or the women at Spirit Moon, she needed a sounding board, it wasn’t going to happen, Nzinga kept them at a distance, kicked up a fuss when Dominique made overtures of friendship to the women they worked with
she decided it wasn’t worth the hassle, and although she sent three letters to Amma, she never heard back when she did receive replies from her parents and siblings
was Amma still angry with her for leaving her and the company?
when she once suggested phoning her long distance from the post office in town, Nzinga sank into a terrible funk for days
it was a sign Dominique was rejecting her
who never mentioned it again.

5
Before arriving at Spirit Moon, Dominique had naïvely thought of housebuilding in purely romantic terms; she’d imagined her lean, long, much admired body becoming even more toned, supple and strong through using it as nature intended – working in the great outdoors, doing strenuous physical exercise, enjoying camaraderie with her co-workers, getting sweaty and dusty and looking forward to showering it off at the end of the day before sitting down to a hearty meal
work would be simple, vigorous and life-enhancing
well, it didn’t quite work out like that
having never lifted anything heavier than stage weights, she found eight-hour days of manual labour unbelievably gruelling, her joints ached and never had time to recover, her smooth, elegant hands blistered, lacerated and coarsened, even underneath protective gloves, and she had to wear a helmet that didn’t shield her face from the sun
she imagined herself down the line: practically crippled, calloused, with a face as craggy as an ancient fisherman
Dominique decided she wasn’t cut out for such work, unlike her co-workers who were built like brick-houses, including Nzinga
they were the butch ones, she was not, and even if she was (she’d never felt the need to categorize herself) it was clear American butches totally outclassed British butches in the Butch Universe
Dominique felt quite femme beside them
at the start of her second week on the job, she refused to get out of bed because her back felt like it was broken, yes, broken, she told Nzinga, looking tragic, doleful, tearful, until Nzinga promised her lighter duties cos I gotta look after my baby, don’t I?
thereafter Dominique’s duties involved minor jobs such as hammering nails, stapling insulation to timber frames, painting, decorating, and providing coffee and snacks several times a day
at home, Nzinga insisted on cleaning the log cabin herself, because she wanted to make sure it was as dust-mite free as possible
Dominique didn’t object, seeing as her idea of housework had always involved waving a feather duster-wand over various surfaces as she skipped around a room
Nzinga also insisted on doing all the cooking because she alone understood how to formulate the right nutritional balance for them to sustain perfect health, which Dominique wouldn’t have minded except Nzinga cooked without salt, which was banned from the house, and spices, which Nzinga said agitated both the stomach and the emotions
eating became both an unpleasant ordeal and a performance of enjoyment
Nzinga also washed Dominique’s clothes, by hand, because I am enslaved by my love for you, she said, in jest or perhaps not, in spite of Dominique’s protestations that she wanted to wash her own undies, especially the ones stained with menstrual blood
Dominique began to regret allowing Nzinga to do everything and make decisions for her
she started to yearn to do the housework herself, yearn to cook, to clean, to do a job that was more intellectually demanding
her life was becoming empty of purpose other than to love Nzinga unconditionally, and, increasingly, obey her
even the simplest things became a source of difficulty
was it really her fault men ogled her in town when she wore (knee-length) shorts and a (sleeveless) baggy tee-shirt
should she really have to cover up instead of being‘provocatively dressed’ as Nzinga accused her
why should she wear her hair (usually a thick, wavy mixture of Afro and Indo) almost shaved to her scalp, cut by Nzinga herself with the barber’s clippers she bought for this very purpose?
why shouldn’t she have a chat with the gentle community baker, Tilley, when she went to collect bread in the mornings?
because the women who appear the nicest are the most passive aggressive and ultimately the most dangerous because they will come between us, don’t you realize that people want to sabotage our great love affair?
and why shouldn’t she read books by men that she’d picked up in the library in town?
you can’t live a womanist life and have male voices in your head, Sojourner
that doesn’t make sense, it’s taking things too far
why don’t you shut your goddam mouth
they were sitting up in bed, it was the early hours, again, Nzinga had been on her case about her past girlfriends for hours, she brought them up every so often, this time trying to convince Dominique they had been playthings who meant absolutely nothing to her
Dominique was fed up of convincing her that past girlfriends weren’t a threat to their present relationship, she’d already told her many times that the love she felt for a couple of them was nothing compared to what she felt for Nzinga, not realizing that to admit any kind of love for her exes was unacceptable
she wanted to leave the room, to sleep elsewhere in the cabin, or on the porch, anything to escape Nzinga’s droning voice; not possible, Nzinga would follow her out of the room and keep it up, sometimes until dawn
they were all white women, they were never going to stick around
I’m the one who left them, it was true, she was the dumper, never the dumpee
what I’m saying is, only a black woman can ever truly love a black woman
okay, I give in, I agree, let’s turn off the light and go to sleep
I don’t want you to give in, I want you to change, to understand my reasoning at a deeper level and accept it as the truth.

Almost a year to the day Dominique had arrived at Spirit Moon, there was a knock on the cabin door late one afternoon
Nzinga was cooking, Dominique had been lying on the sofa staring emptily at the clouds moving in the sky
it was Amma standing before her, delighted to see her
fucking hell, Dominique shouted, it was so good to see her, they collided in a hug
I was so worried about you, Dom, one postcard when you arrived and that was it, you never answered my letters
what letters? Dominique was about to say when Nzinga appeared behind her and asked why she’d invitedthis person to stay?
she hadn’t, Dominique answered, cringing, isn’t it great Amma’s here?
Nzinga said nothing, returned to the kitchen, resumed cooking
undeterred by Nzinga’s rudeness, Amma marched into the main area of the open plan living room cum kitchen and inspected it as if expecting to see corpses hanging from the beams by meat hooks
she flung her knapsack on the floor, threw herself on to the sofa, I’m parched, Dom, gimme a tonic water with ice and you can throw vodka in it as well, you know the drill
Dominique had to explain the house was an alcohol-free zone, as she poured Amma water from the filtered jug
since when, Amma asked (with her face)
Nzinga created an atmosphere glutinous with tension as she silently prepared a thick, garlicky bean and mushroom stew which she served with wholemeal bread
on the wooden dining table– a bench either side
Nzinga looked down at her food as she ate, Dominique could tell Amma found the meal unpalatably bland, she’d asked for salt, there was none
by now Dominique was almost used to a salt and spice-free diet, the initial cravings had gone, her appetite had adjusted its expectations
she asked her friend about everyone back home, eager to know the goss, careful not to show any affection for those she’d left behind, or regret at leaving them
Amma volleyed back a few questions about life at Spirit Moon
Dominique told her they work on the building site five days week, sometimes six, spend evenings back here, often exhausted, Nzinga cooks up a storm in the evenings, early nights usually, weekends they go shopping and for walks, they have a vegetable garden which needs tending, read books– by women, it goes without saying, preferably feminist, sometimes they see a film in town, walk out if it’s offensive
she wanted to add– it’s a bit like you and I in our early theatre days, Amma, except we never left a show that offended us without heckling, she didn’t say this, Nzinga would feel undermined, Dominique would be accused of elevating her bolshie history of heckling with Amma over their relatively passive cinemawalk-outs
Dominique answered Amma’s questions, no, they didn’t mix with the other women in the community, preferring not to get involved, and yes, life was quiet, how they liked it, it was perfect, that’s what it was, perfect
as she spoke, Dominique was embarrassed by how pathetic and puritanical her life sounded, how devoid it was of the happenings of back home, the never-ending dramas of relationships and the women’s scene, the highs and lows of running a theatre company, the city itself, the politics, the demonstrations against Maggie Thatcher, protests against Clause 28, marches to Reclaim the Night, weekends spent at Greenham Common, their outlaw friends who were involved in ‘lost’ cheque-book scams, who lined their shopping bags with silver foil to avoid alarm detection in department stores, who jumped over ticket barriers at tube stations and jumped traffic lights as a rule
it felt so long ago, so far away
the year spent with Nzinga had been without regular updates to Amma, who would have questioned and challenged her on everything
she was her sounding board, her truthsayer, her Number One supporter
Nzinga only looked up when she’d finished eating, gonna hit the sack, she took the pottery bowl to the metal sink and before she reached it, hurled it in with such force, it smashed and shards flew out
she brushed past Amma as she stormed across the floor to the bedroom, Sojourner, you coming?
who’s Sojourner? Amma asked as Dominique leapt up
Dominique didn’t answer as she left the room
it was seven p.m.
the next morning Dominique found a chance to sit with her friend on the steps outside while Nzinga was in the shower
she takes ten minutes, Dominique said, glancing nervously behind her, it’s a ritual she won’t forgo, even with you here
Amma suggested they take a walk away from the madhouse, Dominique said the stoop would have to do otherwise Nzinga would get suspicious
suspicious of what?

The field opposite the cabin that morning was of the most vivid-green ryegrass as it extended all the way out of sight to the end of the property
a pine forest was visible in the distance, the sky was a heavenly, cloudless blue
Dominique was proud to show off the view to Amma who knew her London flat so well, with windows that backed on to a pub’s blackened walls and belching water pipes
surely Amma would be convinced she’d made the right move in at least one respect – this is paradise, right?
Amma mumbled something about the right place with the wrong person and complained about the godawful cup of dandelion‘coffee’ she’d been forced to drink as the real thing wasn’t allowed, and she now had a banging caffeine withdrawal headache barely numbed by the painkillers Nzinga had caught her popping out of their plastic casing at breakfast, who then proceeded to tell Amma off for bringing drugs into her home
the only words she’s spoken to me so far, Dom
they sat there for a moment, soaking it up, Dominique wondering when Amma was going to kick off
she didn’t disappoint, launched into one about her friend being under the Evil Cindy’s spell and did she know that cult gurus controlled their followers by cutting them off from their family, friends, colleagues, neighbours, anyone who might intervene and say, hey, what’s happening here?
I’m going to organize a rescue attempt, Dom, a group of mates from London who’ll descend like an SAS squad and rescue you from Batshit Crazy Cindy
she laughed, Dominique didn’t
I’m in the middle of something, Ams, I’m trying out a new way of living, a new way of being, Nzinga is showing me how to live a truly womanist life, male energy is disruptive, Amma, the patriarchy is divisive, violent and authoritarian, misogyny is so unthinkingly entrenched I can see why women give up on them for ever, it’s so special here, so liberating to be removed from having to deal with male oppression every day
I’ve always known you to like men, Dom, we even love those who are close to us, we might understand the patriarchy (thanks for telling me how it works by the way), but we see men as individuals, don’t we? you were never separatist or misandrist, what’s happened to you?
nothing’s happened to her, Nzinga’s voice boomed over their heads, she’d been standing behind them
she wedged one damp, muscular leg between the women, and then the other, effectively separating them physically– they’d been linking arms
Nzinga plonked herself down in the space she’d created, was wearing a towel, still dripping wet, launched into a speech about all men ultimately being complicit in a patriarchal system that enabled female genital mutilation and seeing as women’s genitalia are being butchered all over the globe in the name of culture or religion or whatever, why not do the same to men who perpetrate most of the world’s sexual violence? bank their sperm when they’re virile teenagers then castrate the bastards
Nzinga pressed herself up against Dominique, an arm around her neck
it felt less like a sign of affection
more like a strangling
Amma stood up, went into the house, packed her carry-all, returned to stand in front of them
I’m off, back home,your home too, Dom, come with me
Dominique didn’t need rescuing, she shook her head
Nzinga pulled her closer, kissed her noisily on the cheek, good girl.

After Dominique and Nzinga had completed ten new properties at Spirit Moon, Nzinga wangled a deal with Gaia to stay in their home until they could secure a contract elsewhere
there was nothing to do except be with each other all day
Dominique should have sloped off then because the relationship was already irreparable, but she found herself unable to make such a big decision when she’d lost the ability to make even the smallest ones, such as what she ate and wore, and who she was allowed to speak to
she became wrapped up in the nightmare cocoon of Nzinga’s increasing paranoia
these women are out to destroy our great love affair, Sojourner
when she came across the other women, Nzinga was at her side so she couldn’t really speak freely to them or she’d be told off later for saying the wrong thing
even her morning trips to fetch bread from Tilley provoked another all-night rant after Nzinga followed her, analysed their body language from a distance and decided they were flirting
Nzinga announced she’d fetch the bread herself from now on, she also went into town on her own to do the weekly shop because of Dominique’s imagined behaviour around men and no, not getting you any chocolate as a special treat, it’s bad for you, and did shereally need to see the dentist (who was a man), or was it a ruse?
the day Nzinga punched Dominique on the arm was the day she thought she’d leave, reasoned it was a one-off, discovered it wasn’t when a single punch progressed into multiple ones
Dominique didn’t want to escalate Nzinga’s aggression by fighting back, until she confessed to herself she didn’t really have it in her to do so, she was genuinely non-violent
when she tried to storm out of the house to get away during rows, Nzinga blocked the door with her imposing size, legs astride, ordered her to sit down on a chair and breathe deeply, Sojourner, breathe deeply, rid yourself of this negative energy, the world is dangerous out there
all day Nzinga’s voice megaphoned into Dominique’s consciousness, resounding, pounding, she spent such little time alone, she forgot how to spend time alone, she took to sleeping in late and going to bed early, she hated being outside in the unrelenting brilliance of sunshine
when she wasn’t sleeping, she was staring into space
it was a Saturday morning, Nzinga had headed into town in the truck to do the weekly shop, saying she’d be gone all day – a test, she usually returned after a couple of hours and snuck up to the cabin on foot to see what Dominique was getting up to
this time, as soon as she left, Gaia appeared outside their home on her moped, as if she’d been parked up somewhere waiting for Nzinga to leave; Dominique heard the engine first, nobody ever came by, who was this?
she watched Gaia walk towards the cabin
Gaia said, we’re concerned about what’s happening here, you’re not the woman you were when you arrived, you haven’t been spotted for over a month, is everything okay?
everything’s fine, Dominique replied, standing at the door, not daring to open it too widely
Gaia stared at her with the knowledge and wisdom of having spent her entire adult life surrounded only by women, she sat on the steps
Dominique, come sit with me
we know what she’s like, Gaia said, we’ve all experienced her wrath, her unreasonableness, her general animosity towards the world, to us, you can talk to me
Dominique resisted saying anything, it would be such a betrayal of Nzinga who insisted on complete loyalty all the while pinching her arm so hard it bruised so that she’d remember to never and I meannever talk to anyone about me or our relationship
you can talk to me, Gaia repeated, laying a light hand on Dominique’s own, transmitting compassionate strength to her, until Dominique felt herself softening and admitted to Gaia, as much as to herself, that yes, she was trapped in a relationship with a violent woman of unsound mind with no foreseeable way out
in betraying Nzinga, she was at last being true to herself
Gaia comforted her, we will help you get away, okay?
really?
do you have any funds?
she never got round to adding my name to what was supposed to be a joint bank account, and asking for my share of our savings will be tantamount to telling her I’m leaving her and I don’t know what will happen then
I can loan you enough money to get yourself sorted, where do you want to go, back to England?
not really, at least not yet, I can’t face the humiliation and I’d like to see more of America
I have friends in West Hollywood who will put you up until you have plans, pay me back when you can, do you have your passport?
Nzinga keeps it safe for me– I know her hiding place
we’ll come by this time next Saturday
to drive you to the airport.

It took years for Dominique to stop beating herself up for staying with Nzinga for as long as she did– nearly three years,three years
how could she have been so weak when she’d been so strong, and was again after she left her?
grateful to go back to the self she had lost
after Spirit Moon, she stayed with Gaia’s lawyer friends, Maya and Jessica, who welcomed her the afternoon she arrived with a meal of fresh salads and a peaceful little yellow room at the back of their expensive property overlooking their orange and lemon grove
that first night Dominique felt disoriented, Nzinga was still in her head, in fact she squatted it illegally for a very long time
she often had nightmares of her coming at her through the bedroom window brandishing the hunting knife she’d had when they met, which she’d kept under the mattress
the next day Maya and Jessica asked her what she’d like for dinner, Dominique wasn’t used to having a choice, spent ages deliberating; in the end they indulged her wishes and barbecued a meat medley of burger, turkey drumsticks, sausages, pork, lamb chops and steak – with salad
after a few bites she ended up running to the loo to throw up, returned and picked at the salad
that evening she stayed up late with the two women who’d met each other at art school, swapped their careers as impoverished artists to pursue corporate law, forwent job satisfaction in order to earn big bucks and work eighteen hour days that killed their creativity
they planned to retire at fifty, resurrect their artistic selves, if it’s not too late
they were enthralled to hear about her theatre and clubbing life in London, admired the fact that she and Amma had chosen a creative path even when it was financially unstable and they’d probably never be homeowners or have a pension
Dominique sat with them in their warm grove drinking delicious wine late into the night
it was like a sedative was wearing off and she felt herself surging with energy
she was hyper, she was high, she was coming back to life.

Dominique fell in love with the West Coast, entered into a marriage of convenience with a gay man, assisted by Maya and Jessica who loaned her the cost
her English accent was a huge selling point in her dealings with Americans, it elevated her, as did her model looks (she was told often enough) and cool biker style, lesbians in particular wanted to help her, to open doors for her, to be part of what they thought she represented
Maya and Jessica allowed her to live cheaply at theirs for a couple of years until she found her feet
her first job was working in admin for a film company, a stepping stone to producing live arts events
she felt blessed that she could quickly establish herself, and once she was, invited Amma to visit
who never said an outright, I told you so
Dominique also attended a weekly counselling group for female survivors of domestic abuse
as the weeks passed she heard people share their life stories and reach life-changing epiphanies
when she took the plunge, she discovered it was indeed cathartic
she came to appreciate that as the oldest girl in a family of ten, she’d had to mother the younger ones when she’d been deprived of being properly mothered herself
as soon as she was born, her mother was pregnant with another child, and each newborn baby had to have her mother’s full attention
Dominique worked out she’d been drawn to Nzinga because she was subconsciously looking to be mothered
then mothering had turned into smothering, and Mummy turned out to be Daddy, as she told Amma, who disagreed and said it was about bad luck rather than unresolved childhood issues, you’re becoming too American, Dom
Dominique kept in touch with Gaia until she passed away, she’d written that Nzinga had been evicted from the community soon after Dominique left, had raged across the property trying to find out where ‘Sojourner’ had gone, threatening people and smashing windows
the police were called, the women didn’t press charges
rest easy, she doesn’t know where you are
Dominique still spent years having nightmares about Nzinga coming at her through a crowd or driving into her as she crossed a street or appeared in a public place, even during her opening speech for the Women’s Arts Festival she founded after a few years in LA
Nzinga would be berating her for leaving her when she’d so kindly taken her on as an apprentice, shown her how to be fully womanist in a misogynist world
I gave you everything,everything, you’d be nothing without me, Sojourner,nothing
many years later, Dominique was told that Nzinga had died some twelve years after she left her
her last girlfriend, Sahara, introduced herself at the festival, she’d become lovers with Nzinga at a women of colour spirituality retreat in Arizona
she talked about you a lot, Dominique, she’d heard about the success of this festival and totally took credit for it, she was your mentor and had made you, she said, you’d used her, no thanks, no public acknowledgement, no belated payments for her extensive investment in your personal development, she was planning to come to LA to confront you, but it was never the right time
I now think she was scared that the person she’d thought of as weak had become powerful
I totally bought her story about you until a few months into our relationship she started treating me like a disciple instead of a lover, and became possessive, aggressive and played mind control games
I was in my twenties, she was in her fifties
she wouldn’t let me out of her sight, said I should be grateful that she’d rescued me, from what? who knows, I never got an answer that made any sense
I was ready to leave her within the year when she had a major stroke, became immobilized, and I couldn’t
she was so utterly alone in the world except for me– no home, friends, no family to call on, she said everyone always left her
when she died, I felt released
hearing of her former lover’s death, Dominique also felt released, sad, too, that Nzinga’s life really had been one of abandonment
and she’d not been capable of seeing that the fault, as an adult, lay with her
Dominique met Laverne in her counselling group, as the only two lesbians they gravitated towards each other
Laverne was an African-American woman who liked to blend into the background, who spoke softly and thought deeply
originally from Oakland, now based in LA as a sound technician, her previous girlfriend had been violent
she left her the third time she ended up in A&E
Dominique found Laverne pleasant and easy company, she’d studied international relations, was well-read and passionately interested in global current affairs
Dominique began to expand her reading beyond women’s literature into non-fiction books about the world at large
they could spend hours discussing the consequences of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the break-up of the Soviet Union
or the marriage war played out in the media between Princess Diana and Prince Charles
or the wars in the Middle East, or the Brixton and LA riots
or the relationship between climate change and capitalism
or the histories of postcolonial Africa, India, the Caribbean and Ireland
their friendship deepened over time and eventually became physical
they respected the free will of each other and made no demands
they were lovers for four years before moving in together, even then Dominique worried that the equilibrium of their relationship, from seeing each other several times a week to seeing each other every day, would throw their relationship off-balance
it didn’t
they wanted children, adopted baby twins, Thalia and Rory, whose parents had been killed in a gangland shooting
they became a family, married each other when it became legal
Dominique moved to America nearly thirty years ago
she considers it her home.
